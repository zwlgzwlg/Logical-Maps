# An open question is a lynchpin when either answer would settle many other
# open questions. The inventory is taken over one representative per
# equivalence class under the chosen background:
#   a ⇒ b ?          implies / excludes / independent / inconsistent / open
#   P consistent ?   for P one principle or two: inconsistent (P ⇒ ⊥),
#                    consistent (a fitting model satisfies all of P), or open
# Each answer is scored by the number of *other* open questions that stop being
# open once it joins the proved records: the rule a ⇒ b or P ⇒ ⊥, or a model
# satisfying P and violating c. A refutation is scored by its least informative
# countermodel, so an actual one settles at least as much. Unknown verdicts in
# recorded models are scored the same way, by adding the principle to the
# model's satisfies or to its violates. Proving a strong conjecture settles
# everything below it and refuting a weak one everything above it, so the two
# scores pull apart; a question scoring well on both is worth answering either
# way. Everything is closure over the same Horn rules, so no engine is rebuilt:
# adding one rule P ⇒ c changes cl(S) to cl(S ∪ {c}) exactly when P ⊆ cl(S),
# because cl(S) is already closed under the other rules and the new rule can
# fire at most once. The statuses mirror Engine.pair and are cross-checked
# against full rebuilds in selftest.

    A question is S ⇒ c for S a set of at most PROGRESS_PREMISES class representatives (none
    implying another, none inconsistent) and c a representative or False outside S. It exists
    only when no proper subset of S already proves or excludes c, so a pair question is asked
    exactly where single premises leave it open; with no premises it asks whether c is a theorem
    of the background, and with c = False whether S is consistent. It is settled by a proof, by an
    exclusion (S ∧ c ⇒ False) or by a fitting model that holds S and fails c, alike. Each open
    question is scored by the other open questions that a proof of it, or its weakest
    countermodel, would settle. Deciding an unknown principle in a recorded model is scored the
    same way, since a model fact settles questions exactly as a proof does.
