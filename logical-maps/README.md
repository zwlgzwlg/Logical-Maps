# Logical Maps

Principles, implications, and countermodels for a topic, with derived consequences and an interactive map. Topic-agnostic; seeded with preference axioms over lotteries.

ZACH'S WARNING: THE INNER WORKINGS ARE ALL VIBE-CODED. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN HERE.

## Collection homepage

Normal builds also generate `build/index.html`, served by the website at
`/logical-maps/`. Write the introduction in [site/introduction.md](site/introduction.md).
It is initially blank on the page. Add future topic IDs to the `maps` list in
[site/config.yaml](site/config.yaml), then rebuild; only built maps are linked.
The config also sets the website and GitHub links. Listed maps receive header
links to the collection homepage, zacharygoodsell.com, and GitHub.

The website importer copies this whole `build/` directory, so the homepage and
starter download travel with the topic pages. Commit and push the exports here,
then redeploy the website. The reusable starter does not include this site's
personal introduction or configuration.

## Reusable starter

`python3 scripts/pmap.py starter` creates `build/logical-maps-starter.zip` from
the curated `starter/` assets and shared tooling. It contains a blank `my-map`
topic, a binary-relation example with executable checks, prebuilt previews,
README/AGENTS instructions, format and update guides, and an MIT licence for
the reusable starter. Research topics and their source documents are not copied
into this archive. See [starter/README.md](starter/README.md).

Normal builds regenerate the archive, copy it beside each topic, and append a
**Create your own logical map** download to Contribute. Publish the complete
topic directory so that relative download works; the central ZIP can also be
linked from a future generic Logical Maps home page. `build --no-starter`
skips regenerating that download when it is not needed.

New result/model scaffolds, schema defaults, and records with omitted status
default to `conjectured`. Existing explicitly proved records keep their status.
`python3 scripts/check_starter.py --python /path/to/clean/venv/bin/python`
tests the downloaded package, its previews and nested bundles, scaffold defaults,
and relative links with Pandoc and Lean absent. Install `requirements.txt` in
that environment first.

`build/<topic>/` is a static site: open `index.html` locally or serve the directory. HTML maths uses locally bundled KaTeX, including when Pandoc is absent. Pandoc renders Markdown when available; otherwise the builder uses Python Markdown.

### Mathematical notation

Use `$...$` or `\(...\)` for inline maths and `$$...$$` or `\[...\]` for displayed
equations in principle statements, formal formulations, notes, proofs, model
descriptions and Markdown pages. For example:

```yaml
statement: |-
  Every $X$ with $P(u(X)=(-1)^{n+1}(n+1))=\frac{1}{n(n+1)}$,
  $n\ge 1$, is indifferent to sure utility $\ln 2$.
```

YAML block scalars (`|-`) or single-quoted strings preserve TeX backslashes.
Use braces for grouped indices and powers: `X_{n+1}`, `(-1)^{n+1}`.
KaTeX 0.18.7 supports standard mathematical LaTeX commands; see its
[supported notation](https://katex.org/docs/supported). Code blocks and inline
code remain literal. Graph labels retain their existing plain-text notation.
The same renderer handles details opened after selection and fetched write-ups.

The scripts, stylesheet, WOFF2 fonts and MIT licence live in
`viewer/vendor/katex/` and are copied into each export's `math/` directory.
Publish/copy the complete topic directory for offline use. Single-file `--out`
exports embed these assets. Maths inherits the current dark/colourblind theme.
Run `python3 scripts/check_math.py` and the UI checks after changing rendering or
mathematical notation; the check requires Node and the Python requirements.

Catalogue papers in `topics/<topic>/papers.yaml`. The Background tab’s Literature section
shows citations, external links, and the principles/results/models referencing
each paper. Record `references` distinguish origins, formulations, proofs,
background, and related work. They do not change arrow-source filters or proof
status. See [the data-format guide](starter/DATA_FORMAT.md#source-paper-catalogue).

Only place documents intended and authorised for redistribution in
`topics/<topic>/sources/`: the builder copies that entire folder into the
public site and downloads. External paper links are not downloaded or bundled.

## The working bundle

`python3 scripts/pmap.py bundle <topic>` writes `build/<topic>/<topic>-map.zip`, a
single self-contained copy of one topic for handing to a person or an AI. `build`
produces it too, and the viewer offers it as the first download. Unpack it anywhere:

```
<topic>-map/
  MAP.md              every principle, proof, model construction and derived verdict, in one file
  OPEN-QUESTIONS.md   conjectures, open pairs, unknown model verdicts, and how to record an answer
  README.md           the semantics, the record formats, and the sourcing rules
  AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md the same rules in imperative form, picked up automatically by coding agents
  data.json           the records, with the background and extraction prose included
  derived.json        every ordered pair's verdict, the classes, and each package's closure
  topics/<topic>/     the editable YAML tree, write-ups, checks, and the source documents
  scripts/ schema/ viewer/ Makefile requirements.txt
```

`python3 scripts/pmap.py validate`, `status` and `build` all run inside the unpacked
bundle, so an editor can add a record and check it without the rest of this repo.
The topic folder is portable: copy `topics/<topic>/` back over this repo's copy.

## Lean

A topic may carry a formalisation in `topics/<topic>/lean/`, declared by `lean_lib` in
`topic.yaml`. The YAML stays the source of truth for statements: each principle names one
hand-written Lean definition in `lean_def`, and `pmap lean` assembles every result and
model statement from its premises and conclusion into a generated `Statements.lean`. A
proof is supplied by inhabiting the generated `Prop`, so it cannot drift from the recorded
claim.

The shape of a statement is the topic's own, declared under `lean:` in `topic.yaml`:
`imports`, `namespace`, a `definition_check` template, and for results and models a
`binder` and how a `principle` applies, with `{def}` standing for the principle's
`lean_def`. Unbounded utility quantifies over a preference order and a witness; another
topic may use plain propositions, a semantics, or whatever its library provides. Without a
declaration, principles are plain propositions and a result reads `A → B → C`. Nothing in
the tooling knows any particular framework, so topics formalise independently.

`pmap lean-check` builds the library and audits wrapper proofs at the generated
statement types. Failed elaboration, `sorryAx`, and nonstandard axioms are rejected. The `lean` certificate field is `none`,
`stated` (statement elaborates, proof missing), or `verified` (machine-checked, sorry-free);
only `lean-check --update` may persist the last. See the topic's `lean/VERIFICATION.md` for current coverage. Build caches under `.lake/` are excluded from the
source zip and the bundle.

## Semantics

Relative to the topic background B, each result is a conjunction of principle
premises implying either another principle or **False**. For example:

```yaml
id: incompatible-example
premises: [a, b, c, d]
conclusion: false
# Add the usual proof, status, certificate, and sources.
```

This says A ∧ B ∧ C ⇒ ¬D, equivalently that A, B, C and D cannot all hold.
It also lets A, B and D rule out C. False is a reserved logical constant,
never a principle, selectable assumption, or premise. YAML `false` and the
string `'false'` are accepted; exported JSON uses the string `"false"`.

The engine computes Horn closure `cl(S)` under the proved records. It does
not enumerate Boolean combinations. The viewer can display a principle and its
negation as separate nodes without adding either to the source records.

- A package is known inconsistent when `False ∈ cl(P)`. Report that conflict
  and its proof; do not display consequences by explosion.
- For a consistent package, P ⇒ c when c ∈ cl(P), and **P ⇒ ¬c** when
  `False ∈ cl(P ∪ {c})`. The latter is an exclusion.
- A model M records `satisfies` and `violates`. Its known positive properties
  follow by closure. It also fails c when adjoining c derives either False
  or one of its explicitly violated principles.
- **P ⇏ c** requires an actual model satisfying P and failing c. It is
  distinct from P ⇒ ¬c, which alone need not establish any model of P.
- Everything else is unknown. Failing to find a model proves no inconsistency.
- Mutually derivable principles collapse to one graph node. Principles
  inconsistent with the background share the False box; background consequences
  share the True box, and so do the reader's own assumptions, so a decision to
  background a principle stays visible where its consequences are. A negative
  assumption puts its principle in the False box. The topic's fixed background
  stays off the graph. These display classes do not change evidence readouts.
- A principle the topic's own background already settles, one that follows from
  it or is excluded by it with no further assumption, starts hidden, since it can
  only ever sit beside True or False. The sidebar still offers it.
- Deriving False or an explicitly violated property from a proved model is
  a validation error. Conjectures never supply proved evidence.

This deliberately supports positive-premise Horn rules and incompatibility
constraints. General disjunctions and arbitrary negative-premise formulas
are outside the current record format. The additional work for exclusions
is a closure query per candidate, not enumeration of all combinations.

Run `python3 scripts/pmap.py selftest` and `python3 scripts/check_falsity.py`
after engine changes. The latter needs Node and checks both engines against
small exhaustive truth tables, plus native Lean False generation. Optional
DOM regression checks are in `scripts/check_falsity_ui.cjs` (requires jsdom).

The map is curated and need not contain every true implication. Add useful
connections incrementally. "Open" means not settled by the current records,
not necessarily unresolved in the literature. Tentative user suggestions may
be recorded as human-proposed conjectures, separately from verified literature
results, without attributing an unverified theorem to a cited paper.

## Theorem trawl

The [theorem-trawl worker](trawl/README.md) fetches a Git snapshot, visits open
questions in centrality order, and gives discovery an editable copy of the YAML
database in a separate quarantine repository. It saves edits and notes throughout
the search, resumes after budget stops, and freezes file diffs for independent
review. Discovery, review and admission have separate evidence records. API providers and models are configurable; live calls
are disabled by default. Run `python3 scripts/check_trawl.py` for offline tests.

## Certificates

Model names describe the construction or ordering rule, using a consistent
family first and a variant only when needed: for example,
**Clipped expectation: eventual dominance** or
**Clipped expectation: continuous ultrafilter dominance [−t, 2t]**.
The three standard clipped-expectation models use bounds [−t, t]; explicit
bounds distinguish the other variants. Here “continuous” means the ultrafilter
comparison ignores infinitesimal errors. Model names and write-up titles match;
authorship, conjecture status, and satisfied/violated principles have their own
fields. A conjectured extension's name describes the proposed extension without
claiming an unknown construction. Display names can change; record IDs stay fixed.

`certificate.source_id` identifies the direct source of a result or model.
Declare each source in `topic.yaml` under `source_catalog` with `id`, short
`name`, and `kind` (`published-paper`, `online-submission`, or `misc`). The
viewer filters and colors records by their named sources. Use the reserved
`misc` source for one-off prompts, original proofs, and user suggestions;
keep the exact author/model, date, and supporting references in the write-up.
Citing a paper's definitions does not make it the source of a new proof.

`produced_by` credits the mathematical author and `recorded_by` credits the
transcription. `checked_by` records actual checks. Every result/model needs
nonempty `sources`, with optional parallel `source_names` for short labels.
`status: conjectured` is displayed but never used as proved evidence. Source
filters recompute evidence-based verdicts from the surviving records. On the
graph, hidden sources still supply proved consequences of the background;
arrow visibility does not withdraw those automatic facts. Legacy author-type
`provenance` is still accepted in old datasets; records without a direct source
are displayed under Misc. until attributed. Lean fields remain optional.

An optional `certificate.trawl` preserves structured discovery, evidence, reviewer,
and admission history for accepted trawl contributions. It does not change the
meaning of `source_id`, proof status, or Lean verification. See the
[trawl provenance workflow](trawl/README.md#evidence-storage).

Optional principle categories are declared in topic order as `principle_categories: [{id, name}, ...]`. Set each principle's `category` to one of these ids. The graph sidebar groups its checkboxes with one show-or-hide control per category; these only control visibility. Topics without categories retain the flat list.

Each category is collapsible in the three lists that show them: the graph sidebar, the lattice sidebar and the theory explorer. One set of open categories serves all three, so a category opened in one is open in the others. A category's summary carries its name, its count and, on the graph and the lattice, one control that acts on the whole category: **hide** while any of it is showing, **show positive** while none of it is. A closed category can therefore still be shown or hidden without opening it, and still reports how much of it is in play: how many of its principles are shown on the graph, how many are chosen on the lattice, and how many are assumed in the explorer. Categories start closed when a topic declares more than one and has more than `CATEGORY_COLLAPSE_MIN` (16) principles, and open otherwise; searching for a principle opens the category it is in.

`require_sources: true` makes validation reject empty result/model sources. It is enabled for the unbounded-utility topic and new topics; the legacy example retains its existing records until its sources are audited.

Add `source_names` alongside `sources`, with one short label per reference in the same order (for example, `Symmetries of Value`). Pop-ups show these labels; write-ups retain the full references. Original AI work should use its actual author/model and date, never an invented attribution.

## Viewer

An optional `topics/<topic>/theme.css` overrides the shared palette for that
topic's map, HTML write-ups, and Lean index. Define light and dark CSS variables
inside `@media screen` to preserve the shared print styling. The stylesheet is
embedded in generated pages and included in the topic downloads.

**Dark mode** and **Colourblind mode** are independent header toggles, remembered
across maps and HTML write-ups. Colourblind mode overrides topic palettes with
one shared light/dark scheme based on [Okabe–Ito](https://jfly.uni-koeln.de/color/#pallet):
sky blue replaces green, orange replaces red, and independence combines both
coloured halves. Open nodes keep their normal fill.

Lattice: a separate Hasse diagram of the conjunctions a chosen handful of
principles generate. It opens with False and True alone. Two routes carry a choice of principles in:
**lattice**, on a selection's own controls in the graph's details pane, draws
the lattice of what is selected and opens this view; **from the graph**, beside
the Lattice heading, takes whatever the graph is showing, negations included and
assumptions left out. The graph reads well at seventy principles and the lattice
at about eight, which is why the two keep separate lists rather than one. Past
the node cap nothing is drawn and the readout says how many would be workable.
The sidebar offers the same
choices per principle as the graph, ✓ for the principle, ✗ for its negation and
a move to the background, and each adds its literal together with its meets
against everything already shown. Each group has the graph's own
show-or-hide control as well, under the same node cap. The toolbar is the graph's too:
a box to find a principle, then **Flip** and **Fit**. One query serves both
diagrams; on the lattice a match nobody has chosen to build with has no node,
and the readout says so rather than pretending otherwise.

**Flip** turns a diagram over, so the stronger principles sit at the top and the
arrows descend. It is one reflection of the finished layout, so nothing else
moves, and the graph and the lattice share the setting: which way a Hasse
diagram reads is a habit of the reader's rather than a fact about either one. The sidebar is the graph's own, moved
across with the tab as it is for the theory explorer, so the background, the
scrolling and the resizable panes are the same by construction, and so is the
arrow-source selector: the lattice is drawn from the selected sources alone, proofs and models both, so
deselecting a source shows the diagram as it stood without that knowledge. A
model outside the selection still appears in the readout, marked as such, but it
does not make an arrow solid. A meet is drawn under a name only when the reader has chosen a
principle equivalent to it, and then under every such name at once, with the
word equivalent above them as on the graph. False and True always name their
own nodes, and the reader's assumptions name them too: a backgrounded principle
joins the ceiling, or the floor when its negation is assumed. A meet nobody has named is an ∧ in a circle, since where it sits
already says it is the conjunction of the nodes above it; the map's own name
for it, if it has one, waits in the readout. An inconsistent meet is the floor. Nothing nests, since on a Hasse diagram the greatest lower bound of two
nodes is their conjunction. A cover whose converse is ruled out by a model is a
solid arrow with a filled head; one whose converse is still open is dashed with
a hollow head, because whether those two nodes are really distinct is the
question the diagram exists to answer. Clicking works as it does on the graph, through the same selection and the
same detail panel: a principle name gives its name, statement and details link,
an ∧ gives its conjuncts, and an arrow gives the proofs behind it and, where
the converse is settled, the model that settles it. The relation shading and
its legend are the graph's too. The node count grows with the subsets, so the
view stops at a few hundred and says so.

Graph: implications, ∧ nodes for multi-premise results, stronger principles lower and ⊥ at the bottom; see [Graph layout](#graph-layout). The arrow options (conjecture arrows, conjectures only, unpublished only, implied and trivial arrows, isolated principles) are set aside for now and keep their defaults. Theory explorer: principles use the same categories and ordering as Graph; mark them positive/negative to edit the shared background; models known to fit are listed, those whose status is unknown below. Clicking a model highlights its row and shows its verdicts beside each principle while preserving the model list and shared assumptions. Click a verdict’s evidence link for its sources and write-up. Click a model for its sources, write-up links, and any unknown assumptions. A model's own page sorts every principle by what the model says about it, satisfied, violated or unknown, each group counted; the principle leads the row and its evidence follows. A model records a few properties and the rest follow from them, so the derived verdicts of a group wait behind a closed disclosure rather than burying the recorded ones. Derived verdicts list the supporting implications and show every direct source used. Unknown verdicts remain unknown. Conjectures: current and previously conjectured results and models, with answers computed from the selected evidence and background. Changes: every principle, result and model by date, and every logged revision of a record (its `changes` entries) under the revision's own date; the details button opens the record page, which shows a hand-written write-up in full when one exists (the record's own summary otherwise, or until the write-up loads), with the Lean source when present. Header downloads: **Content bundle (ZIP)** is a complete working copy with topic sources, summaries, viewer, and build tools; **Lean files**, when present, opens the formalisation files. Hover over a link for its contents.

### Graph layout

Vertical position is logical strength: stronger principles sit lower and
implication arrows ascend. Principles inconsistent with the background share
an **equivalent** box with ⊥, at the bottom. Principles that follow
from the background share a box with ⊤. **Trivial arrows**, off by
default, shows False ⇒ every displayed node and every displayed node ⇒ True.
These logical arrows have their own explanation and do not change source
filters, proof evidence, or the treatment of inconsistent assumptions.

An ∧ collects its premises below them, with solid strokes descending into it,
drawn a little thinner and lighter than an implication arrow, in the tone of
the ∧ glyph itself. When a proved conjunction is equivalent to a principle, the ∧ sits inside
that principle's equivalence box, with the strokes landing directly on its
circle. There is no arrow inside the box. Other consequences retain their
arrows, and clicking the ∧ provides the equivalence proofs and all its
consequences. Mutually implying conjunctions also share an equivalence box,
even when no individual principle represents it; each retains its own ∧ and
premise strokes. An inconsistent conjunction similarly belongs inside False.
A conjectured reverse implication does not establish equivalence.

Panning and zooming persist. Redrawing after a change of content leaves the
view where the reader put it; only the first draw, a resized graph pane and the
fit button restore the whole diagram.

Principles are ranked by their implication order. Barycenter sweeps and
adjacent swaps reduce crossings; separate connected clusters are packed side
by side. Isolated principles occupy compact labelled bands above the diagram.
⊤ always appears, including when every principle is hidden. Both constant
boxes use just their symbols, ⊤ and ⊥, and remain visible when their trivial
arrows are hidden.

Arrowheads are filled. Each arrow's details panel reports the converse, and for multi-premise arrows whether the remaining
premises still suffice without each one. **Transitive reduction**, on by default, hides an
arrow when a chain of other displayed arrows already gives it, as in a Hasse
diagram; a proved arrow is never hidden through a conjectural chain, nothing
is hidden inside a cycle, and node positions do not change, since the layout
always uses the full arrow set. It also hides an arrow that repeats a premise
stroke: when C is equivalent to A ∧ B, the strokes from A and B into the ∧
inside C's box already say what C ⇒ A and C ⇒ B say, so only the strokes are
drawn. A box and the ∧ circles it holds are all equivalent, so when several of
them carry the same consequence only one arrow to it is drawn; two arrows that
both leave the box itself record separate theorems and are both kept.

Clicking a principle (on the graph or in the sidebar), or an ∧, shades other
principles and conjunction circles by their relation to it. The legend first
reports the selection's own standing: consistent with the background and the
model that witnesses it, consistent on evidence outside the selected sources,
not shown consistent, or inconsistent. A selection that nothing settles is
drawn with a dashed border, since every triangle below needs a model of the
selection and such a selection has none. Each circle uses its
full premise set, whether standalone or inside an equivalence box. Entailed principles use solid green and
excluded principles solid red. A green upper-left triangle means a recorded model
satisfies both the selection and the principle; a red lower-right triangle means
a recorded model satisfies the selection and the principle's negation. An
uncoloured half retains the normal node fill. Both coloured halves mean
**independent of selection**: both kinds of model exist. A single
countermodel establishes non-implication, not independence. Proved entailment
or exclusion takes priority over consistency shading. Open questions retain
their normal fill; conjectures use a separate pattern when no proved relation
or consistency witness is available. False and the principles equivalent to it
are excluded by every consistent selection. The legend always shows four keys:
**entailed**, **excluded**, **consistent**, and **negation is consistent**, including
zero counts. A node with both coloured halves contributes to both consistency
counts. Standalone circles contribute to these counts; an enclosed circle is
counted through its equivalence box. Hover text gives a concise relation label.
Proofs come from the arrow engine (displayed
sources plus background proofs), models from the selected evidence, exactly as
in the theory explorer; a witness available only outside the selected sources
is reported as such. **Shift-click** adds or removes principles from a joint
selection; there is no two-principle limit. Clicking a conjunction selects its
members. Related, redundant and equivalent principles remain individually
selected, and shading is relative to the whole selected conjunction.
A background-inconsistent principle or conjunction highlights every box in the
excluded colour, with an inconsistency notice. Proof readouts continue to report
the inconsistent antecedent. The shading survives reading an
arrow's details and clears with Escape or a click on empty space. The details
of a selected principle or joint selection also offer the sidebar's own moves
on it: **Hide** unchecks it, **Add negation** checks its negation, and **Move
to background** assumes it, each with the sign the selection carries. The same
three are offered on the lattice, where they act on the lattice's own choices.

Graph descriptions occupy a reserved bottom panel, with the fixed relation legend
above the scrolling details and a one-line foot below them. The legend leads with
the selection itself, then the four colour keys, then the controls that act on it:
**details**, **Hide**, **Add negation**, **background**, and **hide equivalents**
when the diagram is showing something the background makes equivalent to the
selection without being part of it. They cost no line of their own. Whether the selection can hold with the background, and which
model witnesses it, goes to the foot, out of the way of both. The standing
instruction shows only while nothing is selected. A relation heading such as
Converse rides on the first line it labels rather than taking one. Below the
readout, a selected principle, or several that are all equivalent, lists every
other principle the background makes equivalent to it, shown or not, with
**show** or **hide** for that principle and **replace**, which hides what is
selected, shows the equivalent in its place and selects it. An arrow
states itself once; its drawn form appears separately only when the background
let the graph drop a premise or contrapose it. Drag its divider or use the arrow keys to resize it;
double-click or press Enter to reset. The height is remembered. Opening or closing
details does not cover or resize the graph. The panel lists selected principles with expandable
definitions and individual remove buttons.

The Conjectures tab shares the background controls. Its sections collapse:
**Central Questions** ranks open questions by the harmonic mean of what the
two answers would settle. If each answer is as likely as the map leaves room
for it, inversely to how much it would settle, that is the number of other
questions an answer is expected to settle, so a question that only matters if
it comes out the implausible way sinks. **Automatically Generated Conjectures**
lists the same questions by their larger side, each stated as the answer to
expect: ⊢ when a refutation would settle more, ⊬ when a proof would, with "if
yes" and "if no" what confirming or refuting that conjecture would settle. A question is S ⊢ c, whether S entails c, for S at
most two principle classes (True, with none) and c a class or False, asked only
where no smaller premise set already proves or excludes c, and settled alike by
a proof, an exclusion or a fitting model; "no" denies the entailment; a model check (model: principle) is scored the
same way. A row that a recorded conjecture asks about carries a star and a details link
to the record. The star is bronze when the record has notes, and silver or gold
when the record says `tier: silver` or `tier: gold`, a human ranking of the
question by importance and difficulty. The ranking is computed at build time for the topic background and
each preset, so an ad-hoc background shows none, and a topic marked `draft: true`
in its `topic.yaml` gets none at all. **Conjectures** lists each
recorded conjecture as the question it asks, in the same format: ⊢ when a result
claims the entailment, ⊬ when a model denies it, with "if yes" and "if no" what
confirming or refuting the conjecture would settle. An open conjecture sits at
its rank with its scores, whether or not it made the ranking's stored top; a
settled one shows its verdict, proved or refuted, and no rank or scores; one
with more than two premises is listed the same way, marked as such. **Show
resolved** is off by default, hiding the settled ones. A sparse map, too open to
rank, still lists and scores its conjectures. Verdicts come from proved
evidence under the background and never from conjectures; a model witnesses a
conjecture's flags, not its proposed construction. The Central Questions description gives the share of
implication questions with up to two premises settled: S ⊢ c for S at most two
principle classes and c a class or False, counted only when no smaller premise
set already proves or excludes c, and settled alike by a proof, an exclusion or
a fitting model. It is computed at build time for the topic background and each
preset; other backgrounds show no share, and hiding a source or enabling
Lean-only does not change it. An inconsistent background shows a warning in
place of both sections.

Optional `was_conjectured: true` on a result or model retains its question
history, whether its status is `conjectured` or `proved`. When changing a
conjecture to `proved`, set this flag, retain its stable ID and add the proof.
If the statement changes substantially, retain the original question and add
a separate proved record. A refuted proposal remains `status: conjectured`,
with the proved refuting evidence recorded separately. Never save a verdict
obtained only under a selected background as a global resolution.

Model info pop-ups show the model name, sources, and write-up links. Model
properties are displayed in Theory explorer; the pop-up and model page omit
the redundant conjunction of satisfied and violated principles.

Isolated principles are packed into compact rows just below the connected
graph. Showing or hiding them leaves the connected layout intact. If no
arrows are visible, the principles form a compact grid instead of one long row.

Graph **Arrow sources** and **Lean-verified only** control displayed proofs.
Sources come in two collapsed groups, **Published papers** and **Unpublished**,
each toggling its members together, with **Show papers** or **Show sources** to
expand individual choices. Partial selection is shown on the group checkbox. The
catch-all `misc` source stands on its own, since neither group describes it.
**Lean-verified only** sits with the sources, so the graph, the lattice and the
conjectures view all reach the one control; a Lean-verified arrow is drawn
thicker than the rest whether or not it is checked. A verdict carries a
**Lean ✓** badge when everything under it is verified, the model and, for a
derived verdict, every result in the chain; the consistency line at the foot of
the details pane carries it beside the witness it names.
Background consequences always use all recorded proved results, including
hidden arrows. For example, DTU still supplies Simple Expected Utility in a
conjectures-only view, so conjecture arrows retain only their additional
premises. Transitive proofs retain the supporting background derivations.
Conjectures never supply automatic background facts or exclusions. The graph
shows only conjectures still open under all recorded proved evidence and the
current background. Resolved questions remain available in the Conjectures tab
under **Show resolved**; they supply neither conjectural arrows nor deductions.

Graph **Conjectures only** hides proved arrows. **Unpublished only** restricts
arrows to sources classified as online submissions or miscellaneous sources,
including unpublished manuscripts. Select both to see unpublished conjectures.
These modes temporarily hide isolated principles and leave background
consequences and other tabs' evidence selections intact.

For the same conclusion, the graph suppresses an arrow whose displayed premise
set strictly contains another sufficient displayed premise set. Thus A ⇒ C
replaces the redundant A ∧ B ⇒ C in the current context. This also applies to
transitive conjunction arrows, while ordinary A ⇒ B ⇒ C and A ⇒ C arrows remain.
A conjecture cannot suppress a proved implication. The original records and
their write-ups remain available, and changing background or source filters
recomputes which arrows are redundant.

Results with the same displayed premises share one ∧ node, with one incoming
link per premise and separate outgoing consequences. This grouping is recomputed
after background simplification and equivalence grouping. Click a shared ∧ node
to list its consequences, then select one to inspect its evidence.

Proved arrows are solid: source colours identify recorded results, and neutral
arrows identify derived proofs. Dashed arrows are conjectural. Derived proofs
can use hidden intermediate principles, background facts, or combined premises;
they need not correspond to a simple path visible on the graph. Clicking an
arrow shows its supporting results. Links collecting premises into ∧ have no
arrowheads or flow chevrons, since an individual conjunct does not imply the whole.

Graph controls use **✓** to show a principle and **✗** to show its negation;
both can be displayed together; unchecking each hides it. **Background** moves
the principle into the shared assumptions, assuming it positively unless only
✗ was selected, and shows it in the True box, or the False box for a negative
assumption. In the background, ✓ and ✗ are exclusive. **Return** displays
the assumed sign on the graph again. Standing topic axioms remain fixed.

Theory explorer edits those same assumptions directly in one principle list.
There is no separate model-filter package or second background panel. Clicking
the selected ✓ or ✗ again removes that assumption. Solid buttons show explicit
assumptions; tinted buttons show consequences. Evidence links sit inline with
principle names, and the Potential models list retains unverified candidates. Contradictory assumptions show their evidence and suppress
inferred graph arrows and model matches. Unknown model properties remain unknown.

Positive assumptions are saved as `?assume=id,id`; negative assumptions use
`deny=id,id`. Both apply to Graph, Theory explorer and Conjectures. Reloading
restores them without changing source YAML, proofs, or downloads. **Clear background** removes all removable positive and negative assumptions.

Negative assumptions are forbidden facts in the Horn engine. A negative conclusion
is proved by adjoining its positive counterpart and deriving a conflict. Signed
graph connections retain the complete contextual premise conjunction: A ∧ B ⇒ C
allows A ∧ ¬C ⇒ ¬B. Source attribution and write-ups remain attached to the
original result; the graph identifies contraposed connections. Negative nodes
have a ¬ prefix and dashed outline. Derived signed arrows use the same proof
queries, without enumerating truth assignments.

Arrow endpoints meet node boundaries along the curve's tangent. Static chevrons
show direction even without highlighting. Highlighted connections have native
SVG chevron motion, capped at 48 moving chevrons, with no per-frame JavaScript.
Motion stops on pointer leave, tab changes, or a hidden document; reduced-motion
preferences retain static chevrons only.

The graph's principle list and background list scroll independently. Moved rows
reserve their space until the pointer or focus leaves the list, preventing the
next move control from jumping under the current click.

Drag the divider beside the sidebar to change its width, or the divider above
Background to change the list's height. Sizes are remembered in this browser
across topics and constrained to the available window space. Focus a divider
and use arrow keys (Shift for larger steps), or Home/End for its limits.
Double-click or press Enter to restore its default size; Escape cancels a drag.

The unbounded-utility map opens with DU in the background: Rich Outcomes,
Archimedean Outcomes, Stochastic Equivalence, Stochastic Dominance, and Mixture
Independence. **DU does not assume Totality; DTU is DU plus Totality.**
Simple EU is a derived consequence, rather than a preset assumption:
Rich Outcomes, Archimedean Outcomes, Stochastic Dominance and Mixture
Independence [imply Simple EU](topics/unbounded-utility/writeups/rich-archimedean-dominance-independence-imply-simple-eu.md).
Simple EU supplies Restricted Totality (comparison of simple gambles), not
Totality for arbitrary gambles. The source's formulation with Simple EU in
place of Archimedean Outcomes is equivalent, since Simple EU also implies
Archimedean Outcomes.
Basic decision theory has **Background DU** and **Background DTU**
buttons in both Graph and Theory explorer. They add the chosen package without removing
other assumptions; adding DU does not remove a separately selected Totality.
These defaults remain removable. An explicit
`?assume=...` selection overrides them; `?assume=` saves an empty background.
**Clear background** removes the removable assumptions, including DU.

Configure such packages with `background_presets` in `topic.yaml`: each has an
`id`, `name`, display `category`, `principles` list, and optional `default: true`.
These are viewer defaults and do not change the mathematical standing background.
The same packages abbreviate long conjunctions in result and model summaries:
for example, **DTU ∧ L¹ Continuity ⇒ Expected Utility**. The largest matching
package is preferred. Matching uses proved implications under the active source
filters and the fixed framework, so redundant premises such as Archimedean
Outcomes in a record already assuming Simple EU need not be repeated. The
selected background and conjectures never supply missing premises for an abbreviation. Result pop-ups offer
**Show full conjunction**, and result write-ups retain every exact premise.

Implications to **⊥** appear as arrows to one special logical node.
A principle ruled out by the selected background has a red outline; its
popup gives the supporting results and sources. False does not appear in the
principle selection list. Model verdicts use the same incompatibility rules
and link their derived failures to the source proofs.

When the background derives False or a negatively assumed principle, the graph is replaced by a red warning
and its proof chain. All arrows return when the conflict is removed. This
uses all recorded proofs, including hidden arrows. Theory explorer verdicts
continue to use the selected evidence sources; validation checks all proved records.
Conjectures and absence of known models do
not establish inconsistency. Old `negates` nodes should be migrated to rules
concluding false, with model assertions moved to `violates` as appropriate.

For a model, list every principle you have actually checked, both ways; the engine fills in the rest and reports what remains unknown.

Run `node scripts/check_signed_ui.cjs` with jsdom available to check signed controls,
URL restoration, contextual contraposition against truth tables, and arrow geometry.
`scripts/check_hasse_layout_ui.cjs` checks the layout convention (floor, ascending
arrows, meets, pinned collapses, bands, filled heads, transitive reduction) on
fixtures and on every graph mode of the built topics; `scripts/check_relations_ui.cjs`
checks relation shading, multiselection, converse readouts and their evidence discipline.
`python3 scripts/check_falsity.py` also checks negative backgrounds and agreement
between the Python and browser engines.
