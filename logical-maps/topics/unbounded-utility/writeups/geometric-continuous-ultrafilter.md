# Clipped expectation: continuous ultrafilter dominance [−4ⁿ, 4ⁿ]

Source: **Misc.** Construction by Zachary Goodsell; specialization and the additional
proofs below by GPT-6 (Codex), 9 September 2026. No independent checker or Lean
verification is asserted.

**Original work: model adaptation and direct verification.** We reuse the continuous
ultrafilter construction from *Decision theory unbound*, Appendix B, Definition 3,
Lemma 6 and Theorem 3. Choosing geometric cutoffs supplies an explicit alternating-game
evaluation and scaling reversal. The CDF-area, $L^{1}$ and folded-expectation verifications
below establish extra properties of this construction. This is an account of work
done for the map, not a claim that these observations are new in the literature.

## Construction and DTU

Outcomes are real utilities; all measurable random variables on the standing sample
space are available. Choose a free ultrafilter \(\mathcal U\) on the positive integers.
Put \(t_n=4^n\), \(c_t(x)=\max(-t,\min(x,t))\), and

\[
v_X(n)=E[c_{t_n}(X)],\qquad
X\succeq Y\iff
\forall\varepsilon>0\quad
\{n:v_X(n)-v_Y(n)\ge-\varepsilon\}\in\mathcal U.
\]

Changing a comparison sequence by a sequence tending to zero leaves this relation
unchanged. A positive lower bound on an ultrafilter-large set gives strict preference.
If a difference converges to a finite number, its comparison is exactly the sign of
that number, including indifference at zero.

Reflexivity is immediate. For transitivity, intersect the two sets corresponding
to tolerance \(\varepsilon/2\). If \(X\not\succeq Y\), ultrafilter dichotomy gives
an \(\varepsilon>0\) and an ultrafilter-large set where
\(v_Y-v_X>\varepsilon\). Thus \(Y\succ X\), establishing totality.
These statements use addition and positive scalar multiplication of comparison
sequences; no multiplication of arbitrary unbounded quotient classes is needed.

Equal laws have identical clipped expectations. For bounded, hence simple, variables
clipping eventually disappears; their comparisons are ordinary expectations. In
particular the normalized chart is the identity and every real utility is realized.
Randomized mixtures satisfy
\(v_{M_p(X,Z)}=p v_X+(1-p)v_Z\), so cancelling the common term and rescaling
\(\varepsilon\) proves both directions of Mixture Independence.

For survival functions \(S_X\), bounded layer integration gives

\[
v_X(n)-v_Y(n)=\int_{-t_n}^{t_n}(S_X(s)-S_Y(s))\,ds.
\]

Stochastic dominance makes the integrand nonnegative. If it is strictly positive
at one threshold, right-continuity gives a positive integral over some bounded
interval. Every sufficiently large cutoff therefore has a fixed positive gap.
This proves strict as well as weak Stochastic Dominance, and finishes DTU.

## Additional expectation and continuity properties

Write \(d=S_X-S_Y\) and \(A_\pm=\int d_\pm\). If at least one of these areas is
finite, monotone convergence of the positive and negative parts over
\([-t_n,t_n]\) shows that the clipped difference tends to the well-defined extended
difference \(A_+-A_-\). The preceding sign criterion proves **CDF-Area Extension**,
including the equality case and both possible infinite signs. Consequently the
recorded CDF-area implications give Relative Expectation and Expected Utility.

For **L¹ Continuity**, clipping is 1-Lipschitz, so for every cutoff

\[
|v_{X_k}(n)-v_X(n)|\le E|X_k-X|.
\]

If this last quantity tends to zero and every \(X_k\succeq Y\), fix
\(\varepsilon>0\) and choose one \(k\) with error below \(\varepsilon/2\).
On the ultrafilter-large set where \(v_{X_k}-v_Y\ge-\varepsilon/2\), we have
\(v_X-v_Y\ge-\varepsilon\). This is exactly the required upper-section closure.
It also applies when other distances in the domain are infinite.

For **Folded Expectation**, put
\(h_X(s)=P(X>s)-P(X<-s)\). Layer integration gives
\(v_X(n)=\int_0^{t_n}h_X(s)\,ds\); boundary atoms change no integral.
If \(h_X,h_Y\) are absolutely integrable, these converge to their folded
expectations. Their finite difference is therefore compared by its sign.

Reflection negates every clipped expectation, proving **Reflection Anti-Invariance**.
For a real constant \(b\),
\(c_t(X+b)-c_t(X)\to b\) pointwise with absolute value at most \(|b|\).
Dominated convergence shows that shifting both compared variables changes the
clipped difference by a sequence tending to zero. This proves **Shift Invariance**.
No individual integrability of the variables is required.

## Explicit failures of scale, alternating evaluation and uniqueness

Let \(A\) have \(P(A=(-2)^j)=2^{-j}\), \(j\ge1\). For
\(2^k\le t\le2^{k+1}\), summing the finite prefix and the geometric tail gives

\[
E[c_t(A)]
=\sum_{j=1}^k(-1)^j+
  \frac{(-1)^{k+1}t}{3\,2^k}.
\]

At \(t_n=4^n\), this equals \(-1/3\), whereas
\(E[c_{t_n}(2A)]=2E[c_{t_n/2}(A)]=-4/3\). Hence

\[
A\sim-1/3\succ-1/2,
\qquad 2A\sim-4/3\prec-1.
\]

This is a concrete scaling reversal in every free-ultrafilter choice used here.
It also directly violates the recorded Alternating St Petersburg Value principle.

The law of \(A\) is the half-mixture of \(-2A\) and sure \(-2\): the sure
branch supplies the first atom and the other branch supplies all subsequent atoms.
Stochastic Equivalence gives
\(A\sim M_{1/2}(-2A,-2)\). The sure gamble \(q=-1/2\) satisfies the same
fixed-value equation by Simple EU, since
\(\frac12(-2q)+\frac12(-2)=q\). Nevertheless \(A\not\sim q\).
With \(p=1/2,a=2,b=0,Z=-2\), these are two witnesses refuting **Uniqueness of
Negative Self-Similarity**.

## Scope and validation

The model satisfies DTU together with CDF-Area Extension, $L^{1}$ Continuity, Folded
Expectation, reflection and shift, yet fails scale and the two calculation/evaluation
principles just exhibited. Further exclusions are derived by the map's implication
records, not asserted without evidence. The free ultrafilter remains nonconstructive.

`checks/geometric_clipping.py` checks the geometric-tail calculation against a
separate finite-sum calculation with a rigorous residual bound, the scaling reversal,
and the finite Lipschitz estimate. Those checks are diagnostics; the quantified
claims rely on the proofs above.

## Failure of Comonotonic Sum Invariance

**Addition: Claude (Fable 5.1), 23 September 2026.** A property of the
recorded model; not a claim of the source paper.

Realize a standard Cauchy variable as \(C=Q_C(U)=\tan(\pi(U-\tfrac12))\) and
put \(X=0\), \(Y=C\), \(Z=C_+=\max(C,0)\), all nondecreasing in \(U\), so both
pairs are comonotonic. The clipping \(\max(-4^n,\min(x,4^n))\) is odd and
\(C\) is symmetric, so \(v_C(n)=0=v_0(n)\) and \(X\sim Y\).

**Doubling-defect identity.** For any nonnegative random variable $V$ and
any $F>0$,

\[2\,\mathbb E[\min(V,F)]-\mathbb E[\min(2V,F)]
 =2\int_{F/2}^{F}P(V>x)\,dx,\]

since $\mathbb E[\min(V,F)]=\int_0^F P(V>x)\,dx$ and
$\mathbb E[\min(2V,F)]=2\int_0^{F/2}P(V>x)\,dx$. For $V=C_+=\max(C,0)$ with
$C$ standard Cauchy the right-hand side is
$\frac2\pi\int_{F/2}^{F}\arctan(1/x)\,dx$, which is positive for every $F$
and increases to $\frac{2\ln2}{\pi}$ as $F\to\infty$.

With \(X+Z=C_+\), \(Y+Z=2C_++C_-\), \(C_-=\min(C,0)\), and
\(\mathbb E[\max(C_-,-4^n)]=-\mathbb E[\min(C_+,4^n)]\),

\[
v_{X+Z}(n)-v_{Y+Z}(n)=2\int_{4^n/2}^{4^n}P(C>x)\,dx\longrightarrow\frac{2\ln2}{\pi}>0.
\]

With \(\varepsilon=(\ln2)/\pi\), the set \(\{n:v_{Y+Z}(n)\ge v_{X+Z}(n)-\varepsilon\}\)
is finite, hence outside the free ultrafilter, while \(v_{X+Z}\ge v_{Y+Z}\)
for every \(n\). So \(X+Z\succ Y+Z\) although \(X\sim Y\): Comonotonic Sum
Invariance fails, even though Shift Invariance, CDF-Area Extension, \(L^1\)
Continuity and Folded Expectation hold. `checks/comonotonic_witnesses.py`
verifies the calculation.

## Rational factors

**Addition: Claude (Fable 5.1), 24 September 2026.** The scaling reversal
above is a doubling: \(A\sim-1/3\succ-1/2\) while \(2A\sim-4/3\prec-1\), so
the pair \((A,-1/2)\) fails invariance at the factor \(2\). The model therefore
also fails Rational Scale Invariance, the restriction of Scale Invariance to
rational factors.
The same doubling refutes Integer Affine Preservation: \(A\succ-1/2\) is
not carried to \(2A\succeq-1\).

## Integer-ratio self-similarity

**Addition: Claude (Fable 5.1), 24 September 2026.** The uniqueness witness
above has ratio $a=2$, so the model also fails Uniqueness of Negative
Self-Similarity (integer ratios), the restriction of the principle to integer
ratios.


## A fixed shuffle copula

**Added 2 October 2026.** The AI-generated report communicated by **Branden
Fitelson**, *Unbounded Utility: Five Top-Ranked Open Conjectures Resolved*
(30 September 2026), §4(b), supplies a new property of this construction.
Its producers are identified as Claude agents, with model versions unspecified.
GPT-6 (Codex) expanded and informally checked the argument.

The [fixed shuffle-copula proof](calibrated-geometric-continuous-ultrafilter.html#shared-clipping-and-shuffle-copula-proof)
applies to this model's cutoffs and tolerance-based ultrafilter comparison.
It proves **Existential Copula Sum Invariance** using one copula for all
triples, including atomic marginals. This does not change the model's
existing failure of Comonotonic Sum Invariance. The original construction
and earlier results retain their original attribution. The expanded model
has no Lean verification; its earlier record was marked stated.
