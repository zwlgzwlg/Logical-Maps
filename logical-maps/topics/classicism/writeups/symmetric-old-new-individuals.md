# Symmetric ideally-full model: old and new individuals

This model was found by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic) on 6 October 2026, in
a session with Cian Dorr, as a countermodel to a principle from another
context. It satisfies □Strong Actuality and refutes Inextensible
Comprehension. Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic) added the remaining verdicts the
same day, and corrected the argument for the failure of Inextensible
Comprehension. No Lean verification is claimed.

The verdicts that matter most for the map are these. Atomicity holds at every
type, and so does ND, while Inextensible Comprehension fails. So Atomicity +
Actuality, with ND and □Strong Actuality added, does not imply Inextensible
Comprehension.

## The model

It is a symmetric ideally-full intensional action model in the sense of
Dorr's draft *Boolean Completeness does not imply Rigid Comprehension*
(Definitions 15–18, p. 8). By that draft's Proposition 20 it is a model of C.

There are two objects:

- $E$, whose individuals are $\mathbb N$;
- $O$, whose individuals are $\mathbb N\sqcup\mathbb N'$, where $\mathbb N'$
  is a disjoint copy of $\mathbb N$.

At $O$, members of $\mathbb N$ are called *old* and members of $\mathbb N'$
are called *new*.

The arrows are functions, and the action on individuals is the identity
action.

| From | To | Arrows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $E$ | $E$ | all injections $\mathbb N\to\mathbb N$ |
| $E$ | $O$ | the injections with range among the old individuals |
| $O$ | $E$ | all injections $\mathbb N\sqcup\mathbb N'\to\mathbb N$ |
| $O$ | $O$ | $G_O$, the permutations preserving old and new; and $K$, the injections with range among the old |

These arrows are closed under composition. A composite that passes through
$E$ and ends at $O$ lands among the old individuals, and so does any composite
with a member of $K$.

The symmetry groups are $G_E=\mathrm{Sym}(\mathbb N)$ and $G_O$. Both objects
carry the ideal of finite sets.

An intension $D$ at an object $W$ is a set of tuples $\langle\bar a,h\rangle$,
where $h$ is an arrow out of $W$ and $\bar a$ are entities at the target of
$h$. The domain at $W$ consists of the intensions that satisfy two conditions:

- **Symmetric.** If $\langle\bar a,h\rangle\in D$, then
  $\langle g\cdot\bar a,g\circ h\rangle\in D$ for every $g$ in the symmetry
  group of $h$'s target. Here $g$ acts on entities by transport.
- **Finitely pinned.** For some finite $N\subseteq W^e$, whenever two arrows
  $h,h'$ with a common target agree on $N$, we have
  $\langle\bar a,h\rangle\in D\iff\langle\bar a,h'\rangle\in D$. This is
  Definition D.2.

The evaluation point is $1_E$. Call an arrow out of $E$ with target $O$
"an arrow to $O$", and so on.

**Single classes.** Two facts drive most of what follows:

- Any finite partial injection of $\mathbb N$ extends to a member of $G_E$.
- Any finite partial injection of $\mathbb N\sqcup\mathbb N'$ that preserves
  old and new extends to a member of $G_O$.

Let $D$ be a symmetric proposition pinned down by $N$ that contains an arrow
$h$. Then $D$ contains every arrow $h'$ of the same kind. To see this, choose
a symmetry $g$ with $g(h(n))=h'(n)$ for $n\in N$. Then $g\circ h\in D$, and
$g\circ h$ agrees with $h'$ on $N$.

Here "kind" means one of the following:

- into $E$;
- from $E$ into $O$;
- in $G_O$;
- in $K$.

Arrows of different kinds differ in target. The one exception is $G_O$ versus
$K$, which are separated by the proposition "the arrow sends $0'$ to a new
individual", pinned down by $\{0'\}$.

So the propositions are as follows:

- **At $E$:** the four unions of $\mathrm{Hom}(E,E)$ and $\mathrm{Hom}(E,O)$.
- **At $O$:** the eight unions of $\mathrm{Hom}(O,E)$, $G_O$ and $K$.

The model therefore meets the conditions finitely-many-propositions and
finitely-many-propositions-everywhere.

## □Strong Actuality (Fable)

Write $f^*p:=\{k: k\circ f\in p\}$ for the transport of a proposition $p$
along an arrow $f$.

**At $E$.** Let $w_E:=\mathrm{Hom}(E,E)$. It is true at $1_E$.

- Along an arrow $f$ to $E$, $f^*w_E=\mathrm{Hom}(E,E)$, since every arrow
  from $E$ to $E$ composed with $f$ is again an arrow from $E$ to $E$.
- Along an arrow $f$ to $O$, $f^*w_E=\mathrm{Hom}(O,E)$.

Both transports are atoms at their targets. So every proposition there
contains or excludes each transport, and $w_E$ is a true strong world.

**At $O$.** The proposition $G_O$ is true at $1_O$.

- Along a member of $G_O$, its transport is $G_O$ again.
- Along a member of $K$, its transport is empty: a composite with a member of
  $K$ misses every new individual, so it is not in $G_O$.
- Along an arrow to $E$, its transport is empty, since a composite of an
  arrow to $E$ with an arrow back to $O$ lands in $K$.

So $G_O$ is a true strong world.

Every world sees only $E$ and $O$. Strong Actuality is a closed sentence, so
its truth at an arrow depends only on the arrow's target. Hence □Strong
Actuality holds.

The actual world at $E$ is $\mathrm{Hom}(E,E)$, which properly contains
$\{1_E\}$, so the arrows from $E$ to $E$ that are not surjective are
actual-world arrows. The singleton of the identity is not pinned, and neither
is the symmetry group $G_E$ as a set of arrows. So the model does not meet
the group's condition symmetry-group-pinned. That condition's argument is
not needed here, since Actuality follows from Strong Actuality.

## ND at every type at $E$

Call an arrow $f:E\to V$ *finitely invertible* if it satisfies the following:
for every arrow $h:E\to U$ and every finite $N\subseteq\mathbb N$, there is an
arrow $k:V\to U$ with $k\circ f$ agreeing with $h$ on $N$.

Every arrow out of $E$ is finitely invertible. In each case we define $k$ on
$f(N)$ by $k(f(n)):=h(n)$ and extend it to an arrow of the right kind:

- If $f$ and $h$ both go to $E$, extend to an injection.
- If $f$ goes to $E$ and $h$ to $O$, extend to an injection into the old
  individuals; this works because $h(N)$ is old.
- If $f$ goes to $O$ and $h$ to $E$, extend to an injection
  $O^e\to\mathbb N$.
- If $f$ and $h$ both go to $O$, extend to a member of $K$. Both $f(N)$ and
  $h(N)$ are old.

Now let $X\ne Y$ be entities of a relational type at $E$, both pinned down by
$N$. They differ at some tuple $\langle\bar a,h\rangle$. Take $k$ as above.
The transport $f\cdot X$ contains $\langle\bar a,k\rangle$ iff $X$ contains
$\langle\bar a,k\circ f\rangle$. By pinning, that holds iff $X$ contains
$\langle\bar a,h\rangle$, and likewise for $Y$. So $f\cdot X\ne f\cdot Y$.

At type $e$, every arrow is injective. So transport along every arrow out of
$E$ is injective at every type, and ND holds at $E$. The map derives ND at
$t$, B, 5 and the pure B schema from this.

ND at $t$ fails at $O$, and so □ND at $t$ fails at $E$. A member $f$ of $K$
gives $f^*G_O=\emptyset=f^*\emptyset$.

## Atomicity at every type, at both objects

Fix an object $W$ (either $E$ or $O$), a relational type, and a finite
$M\subseteq W^e$. Let $D_M$ be the set of entities pinned down by $M$. It is
closed under arbitrary unions and under complement, so it is a complete
atomic Boolean algebra. Its atoms are the classes of an equivalence relation
on tuples, which is generated by two kinds of step:

- the symmetry steps
  $\langle\bar a,h\rangle\sim\langle g\cdot\bar a,g\circ h\rangle$;
- the pinning steps $\langle\bar a,h\rangle\sim\langle\bar a,h'\rangle$, for
  $h,h'$ agreeing on $M$.

A symmetry step after a pinning step can be traded for a pinning step after a
symmetry step. So the class of $\langle\bar a,h\rangle$ is

$$
c_M(\bar a,h)=\{\langle g\cdot\bar a,h'\rangle : g\in G_V,\ h'\text{ agrees with }g\circ h\text{ on }M\},
$$

where $V$ is the target of $h$.

A class $c_M$ is an atom of the whole domain if it is *stable*, meaning that
$c_{M'}(\bar a,h)=c_M(\bar a,h)$ for every finite $M'\supseteq M$. Indeed,
suppose a nonzero $Z\subseteq c_M$ in the domain is pinned down by $M''$.
Then $Z$ is a union of $(M\cup M'')$-classes, and the only one inside $c_M$
is $c_M$ itself.

Let $P\subseteq V^e$ be the union of finite pinning sets of the arguments
$\bar a$, where an individual argument pins itself. Let $\mathrm{Reach}(h)$
be the set of individuals that some arrow of $h$'s kind can take as a value:

- all of $V^e$ for arrows into $E$ and for $G_O$;
- the old individuals for arrows from $E$ into $O$ and for $K$.

**Claim.** The class $c_M(\bar a,h)$ is stable provided three conditions
hold:

1. $h(M)\supseteq P\cap\mathrm{Reach}(h)$;
2. when $W=O$, $M$ contains a new individual;
3. $h$ is injective, which it always is.

*Proof.* Let $M'\supseteq M$, and let $h'$ agree with $h$ on $M$. We need a
symmetry $s$ satisfying three conditions:

- $s\cdot\bar a=\bar a$;
- $s$ fixes $h(M)$ pointwise;
- $s(h(m'))=h'(m')$ for $m'\in M'\setminus M$.

By condition 2, $h$ and $h'$ are of the same kind. Indeed, if $W=O$, a new
individual in $M$ goes to a new one under members of $G_O$ and to an old one
under members of $K$.

Now take $m'\in M'\setminus M$. The values $h(m')$ and $h'(m')$ lie in
$\mathrm{Reach}(h)$ outside $h(M)$, by injectivity. By condition 1 they lie
outside $P$. They also have the same status. For members of $G_O$ this is the
status of $m'$; otherwise every value in $O$ is old, and $E$ has no statuses.

So the finite partial injection that fixes $P\cup h(M)$ and sends each
$h(m')$ to $h'(m')$ preserves status. It therefore extends to a symmetry $s$.
A symmetry fixing $P$ pointwise fixes each argument, since transport along
an arrow that agrees with the identity on a pinning set is the identity.
So $\langle\bar a,h'\rangle\in c_{M'}(\bar a,h)$.

In general, an element of $c_M$ has the form $\langle g\cdot\bar a,h''\rangle$
with $h''$ agreeing with $g\circ h$ on $M$. Applying $g^{-1}$ reduces this to
the case just treated. $\square$

**Every nonzero entity has a stable class below it.** Let $X\ne\emptyset$ be
pinned down by $N$, and let $\langle\bar a,h\rangle\in X$. Choose finitely
many fresh points of $W^e\setminus N$, including a new one when $W=O$. Choose
an arrow $h'$ of $h$'s kind that agrees with $h$ on $N$ and sends the fresh
points onto $P\cap\mathrm{Reach}(h)\setminus h(N)$, with each status going to
the same status. This is possible for each kind, since an injection, an
injection into the old individuals, or a status-preserving permutation can be
prescribed on finitely many points.

Then $\langle\bar a,h'\rangle\in X$ by pinning. Let $M$ be $N$ together with
the fresh points. The class $c_M(\bar a,h')$ is stable. It lies inside $X$,
because $X$ is symmetric and pinned down by $N\subseteq M$, so it is a union
of $M$-classes. Hence $c_M(\bar a,h')$ is an atom below $X$.

So Atomicity holds at every relational type at $E$ and at $O$. Atomicity is
closed, so □Atomicity holds as well. The argument does not depend on what the
individuals are, so it holds in the variant with one individual too.

## Inextensible Comprehension fails (corrected)

Fable's summary named the property of being old. That property does not by
itself refute Inextensible Comprehension: it is weakly inextensible at $E$.
The failure is the following.

Let $X$ be the universal property of individuals at $E$, and suppose $Y$ is
coextensive with $X$ and inextensible. Let $Y$ be pinned down by $N$.

1. **$Y(f)=\mathbb N$ for every arrow $f$ to $E$.** Take a permutation $g$
   agreeing with $f$ on $N$. Then $Y(g)=g\,Y(1_E)=\mathbb N$, and by pinning
   $Y(f)=Y(g)$.
2. **$Y(\iota)$ is old, for $\iota$ the inclusion of $\mathbb N$ into $O$.**
   Being old is pinned down by $\emptyset$, and every individual of $E$
   necessarily has it, since arrows into $O$ from worlds over $E$ land among
   the old. By weak inextensibility at $E$, $Y\le$ old there. So $0'\notin
   Y(\iota)$.
3. **$Y$ is not weakly inextensible at $\iota$.** Let $Z:=\lambda y\,.\,y\ne
   0'$, in the domain at $O$, since it is symmetric under $G_O$ and pinned
   down by $\{0'\}$. Every $Y$-thing at $\iota$ is distinct from $0'$, and
   necessarily so, since all arrows are injective. Now take any $m:O\to E$.
   At the world $m\circ\iota$, which is an arrow to $E$, $Y$ holds of
   $m(0')$, by step 1. But $Z$ fails of $m(0')$ there.

So no coextensive $Y$ is inextensible. This argument uses the individuals,
so it is recorded for the base individuals only.

## BF at $t$ and the Strong Leibniz Biconditionals fail

**BF at $t$.** Every transport from $E$ to $O$ lies among $\emptyset$,
$\mathrm{Hom}(O,E)$, $\mathrm{Hom}(O,O)$ and $\top$, and never equals $G_O$.
Let $X$ be the property of propositions that holds of every proposition at an
arrow to $E$, and of every proposition other than $G_O$ at an arrow to $O$.
It is symmetric, because $G_O$ is invariant under $G_O$, and it is pinned down
by $\emptyset$. Then $\forall p\,.\,\Box Xp$ holds at $E$, while at $\iota$
the proposition $G_O$ lacks $X$.

**Strong Leibniz at $t$.** The proposition $\mathrm{Hom}(E,O)$ is possible,
and its only nonzero part is itself. Along $\iota$ it becomes $G_O\cup K$,
which $G_O$ neither contains nor excludes. So it is not a strong world.

## Boolean Completeness fails at $e\to t$

For $n\in\mathbb N$, let $\eta_n:=\{\langle k(n),k\rangle\}$ be the haecceity
of $n$. Suppose $L$, pinned down by $N$, were the least upper bound of the
$\eta_n$ for even $n$.

Take an odd $m\notin N$ and an even $n\notin N$, and a permutation $g$ that
fixes $N$ pointwise and sends $m$ to $n$. We have $\langle n,1_E\rangle\in L$.
By symmetry, $\langle m,g^{-1}\rangle\in L$, and by pinning,
$\langle m,1_E\rangle\in L$.

But $\{\langle x,k\rangle : x\ne k(m)\}$ is an upper bound of the $\eta_n$ for
even $n$, pinned down by $\{m\}$, and it omits $\langle m,1_E\rangle$. This
contradicts the leastness of $L$.

So Boolean Completeness fails at $e\to t$ (base individuals). It still holds
at $t$, where the algebras are finite.

## With one individual: □BC and □Rigid Comprehension

In the variant with a single individual, the failures of Inextensible
Comprehension and of Boolean Completeness above disappear. Both used
individuals: the parameter $0'$, and haecceities of infinitely many numbers.

Call the following four classes of arrows the *kinds*:

- the arrows into $E$;
- the arrows from $E$ into $O$;
- $G_O$;
- $K$.

The kind of a composite is fixed by the kinds of its factors.

**Claim.** At each object, every entity of each type is a union of classes,
one class for each kind of arrow and each tuple of arguments. Every entity is
fixed by every symmetry, and each domain is finite.

*Proof, by induction on types.* The single individual is fixed by every
symmetry. Suppose the arguments at every object are fixed by every symmetry,
and there are finitely many of them.

1. **Classes are determined by kind.** The class of a tuple
   $\langle\bar a,h\rangle$ under pinning by $M$ is the orbit of
   $(\bar a,h\restriction M)$. Since $\bar a$ is fixed, the orbit is
   determined by the kind of $h$. At $O$ this needs $M$ to contain a new
   individual, which separates $G_O$ from $K$. Larger $M$ split nothing
   further.
2. **The domain is finite.** An entity is a union of such classes, and there
   are finitely many of them.
3. **Entities are fixed by symmetries.** Precomposing with a symmetry
   preserves kinds, so every entity is fixed by every symmetry. This carries
   the induction to the next type. $\square$

So every domain is a finite Boolean algebra, hence complete. BC holds at $E$
and at $O$, and so does □BC.

**Transport depends only on kind.** The transport of an entity along an arrow
depends only on the arrow's kind, since kinds of composites are determined by
the kinds of their factors.

**Rigid Comprehension.** Given $X$ at an object, let $Y$ be the intension
whose extension at $h$ is the transport along $h$ of $X$'s extension at the
identity. This is the witness used for full action models.

- $Y$ is a union of classes, so it is in the domain.
- $Y$ is coextensive with $X$.
- $Y$ is persistent, since its extension at $h\circ j$ is its extension at
  $h$ transported along $j$.
- $Y$ is inextensible. Suppose every $Y$-thing at a world is necessarily
  $Z$. Then at every later world, each $Y$-thing is the transport of one of
  them, so it is $Z$ there.

This works at both objects, so □Rigid Comprehension holds.

## Other verdicts

- The group's shared arguments give the failure of Relational Choice
  (transposable) and the Axiom of Infinity at $e$.
- The topic's general arguments for finitely many propositions give the
  failure of the Infinity schema, the Axiom of Infinity and Possible Infinity
  at $t$.
- The map derives the rest, including the failure of No Pure Contingency
  (ND holds at $t$ and □ND at $t$ fails) and of the Distinctness-preserving
  collapse (Actuality holds and Inextensible Comprehension fails).
