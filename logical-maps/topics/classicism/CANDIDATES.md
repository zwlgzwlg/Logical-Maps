# Classicism: candidate principles

Principles that may be added to the map later. None of them is recorded yet.
Each needs a decision before it is added, usually because it opens a family of
variants or connections. Notation follows `background.md`. Remove an entry
once it has been recorded or rejected.

## Weak variants of Rigid Power

*Added 3 October 2026.* Rigid Power (`rigid-power-r`, Goodsell 2019) says:
if $F$ is rigid, so is $P_F:=\lambda X\, .\,\operatorname{Rigid}(X)\land X\le F$.
"Rigid" can be replaced by "weakly rigid" in three places:

- **H**: the hypothesis on $F$;
- **I**: the condition inside the power property, $\lambda X\, .\,\underline{\ \ }(X)\land X\le F$;
- **C**: the conclusion about that property.

Write a variant as a triple over $\{R,W\}$, so that Rigid Power is
$(R,R,R)$. Cian Dorr's "natural" reading of "Weak Rigid Power" is $(W,W,W)$.

*Recorded 10 October 2026:* $(W,W,W)$ is now `weakly-rigid-power-r` (Weakly Rigid
Power), with its necessitation. The instances at $F:=\lambda\bar x\, .\,\top$ are also
recorded: $(R,R,R)$ there is Rigid Rigidity (`rigid-rigidity-r`), and $(W,W,W)$ there
is Weakly Rigid Weak Rigidity (`weakly-rigid-weak-rigidity-r`). The other six
variants remain candidates.

### Logical relationships

Write $P^R_F$ and $P^W_F$ for the two power properties, with "rigid" and "weakly
rigid" inside.

- *Monotonicity.* With I fixed, weakening the hypothesis or strengthening the
  conclusion strengthens the principle. So $(W,I,R)$ is the strongest variant with
  that I, and $(R,I,W)$ the weakest.
- *Weakly Rigid Power is the strongest of the eight.* Take any variant with
  $H=I=W$. A weakly rigid $F$ falls under $P^W_F$, so the weak persistence of
  $P^W_F$ gives $\Box\operatorname{WeaklyRigid}(F)$; this is
  `weakly-rigid-power-implies-tame-rigidity`, and it uses only weak persistence.
  As a schema, such a variant therefore gives Tame Rigidity at every type. Under
  Tame Rigidity, H no longer matters, and C no longer matters either (by Tame
  Rigidity at the type of the power property). So $(W,W,W)\Leftrightarrow(W,W,R)$.
  - The two $I=W$ variants with $H=R$ follow by monotonicity.
  - It also gives Rigid Power (recorded), and with Tame Rigidity that gives
    $(W,R,R)$, the strongest of the $I=R$ variants. So Weakly Rigid Power implies
    all eight.
- *Inside W carries □Tame Rigidity.* A weakly rigid relation is persistent
  (Background). So in any variant with $I=W$, the conclusion makes $P^W_F$
  persistent: necessarily, every weakly rigid $X\le F$ is rigid. Conversely, given
  that, $P^W_F$ and $P^R_F$ are necessarily coextensive, hence identical. So
  $(R,W,C)$ is equivalent to $(R,R,C)$ together with □Tame Rigidity below every
  rigid relation.
  - $\lambda\bar x\, .\,\top$ is rigid in C at type $t$, and is rigid at the other
    types given □BF. So at $t$ the $I=W$ variants give □Tame Rigidity outright.
    Under □BF, $(R,W,C)\Leftrightarrow(R,R,C)+{}$□Tame Rigidity.
  - With $H=W$, BF suffices, since $\lambda\bar x\, .\,\top$ then only needs to be
    weakly rigid (`barcan-and-weakly-rigid-power-imply-necessary-tame-rigidity`).
- *Collapse.* Under Tame Rigidity at every type, H and C drop out and two classes
  remain: the $I=R$ variants, all equivalent to Rigid Power, and the $I=W$
  variants, all equivalent to Weakly Rigid Power. Under □Tame Rigidity all eight
  are equivalent to Rigid Power, by `necessary-tame-rigidity-and-rigid-power-imply-weakly-rigid-power`.
  □Rigid Comprehension and C5 both give □Tame Rigidity (recorded), and C5 gives
  □Rigid Power, so all eight hold in C5.
- *The weakest, $(R,R,W)$.* It is the weak inextensibility of $P^R_F$ at the
  evaluation point only, since persistence is free for $I=R$. Its necessitation
  gives Rigid Power (rigidity of $F$ is necessary), so with No Pure Contingency,
  as in one-object models, the two coincide.
- *Open.* Do Tame Rigidity and Rigid Power give Weakly Rigid Power? This is the
  recorded conjecture `tame-rigidity-and-rigid-power-imply-weakly-rigid-power`; a
  countermodel needs Tame Rigidity and Rigid Power without □Tame Rigidity at type
  $t$. Does $(W,R,R)$ give Tame Rigidity? Does Rigid Rigidity give Rigid Power?
  That is the recorded conjecture `rigid-rigidity-implies-rigid-power`; the
  argument offered for it assumed that rigidity is closed under conjunction,
  which fails when identity is contingent.

### What the unboxed premises give

The recorded result `necessary-bf-atomicity-and-rigid-comprehension-imply-necessary-rigid-power`
derives □Rigid Power, the full $(R,R,R)$, from boxed premises. Its argument at a
single world $v$ uses BF, Atomicity and Rigid Comprehension at $v$, and it
establishes the weak inextensibility of $P_F$ at $v$. Run once at the evaluation
point, from unboxed premises, it gives:

> **BF + Atomicity + Rigid Comprehension ⇒ $(W,R,W)$**: if $F$ is weakly rigid,
> then $\lambda X\, .\,\operatorname{Rigid}(X)\land X\le F$ is weakly rigid.

- *Hypothesis W suffices.* The argument uses $F$ only at the evaluation point,
  in two places. One is the atom lemma for $F$: below an atom, every instance of
  $F$ is identified with an actual instance. It uses only the unboxed weak
  inextensibility of $F$. The other is $X'\le F$, which uses only the persistence
  of $F$. Weak rigidity of $F$ (weakly persistent, which with weak inextensibility already gives persistence) would also do.
- *Inside R is needed.* The conclusion's persistence clause is free for $I=R$.
  For $I=W$ it would need □Tame Rigidity, but unboxed Rigid Comprehension gives
  Tame Rigidity only at the evaluation point.
- *Conclusion W only.* $\operatorname{Rigid}(P_F)$ needs weak inextensibility at
  every accessible world $v$. The argument would need an atom below the failure
  at $v$ that is possible relative to $v$, and a pull-back by Rigid Comprehension
  at $v$. Actual-world atoms and an actual rigid pull-back do not suffice without
  B, because expressing "accessible from $v$" needs a backward modality. RC + BF ⇒
  □BF is recorded, so BF at $v$ is available; Atomicity and Rigid Comprehension
  at $v$ are not.

*Open question:* do unboxed BF + Atomicity + Rigid Comprehension give Rigid Power
itself? No countermodel is known.

## Finiteness of rigid extensions

*Added 3 October 2026.* "Everything rigid has a finite extension":
$\forall F\, .\,\operatorname{Rigid}(F)\to\operatorname{Finite}(F)$, where $F$ has
a finite extension when some finite cardinality (`background.md`, Infinity) holds
of it. Variants replace Rigid by Weakly Rigid, Inextensible or Weakly
Inextensible, and perhaps Persistent.

Points to settle first:
- In the finite-support truncation model, every rigid property of individuals
  has finite extension.
- $\operatorname{Inextensible}(\top_{\sigma t})$ is equivalent to □BF at
  $\sigma$. So with infinitely many entities, □BF refutes the Inextensible and
  Rigid variants at that type, and Rigid Comprehension refutes the rigid variant
  given the Axiom of Infinity.
- The variants interact with the Axiom of Infinity and Possible Infinity, and
  with which types are allowed. Decide the type range before recording.

## Maximalizations of extensions of C

*Added 3 October 2026.* Bacon, *A Philosophical Introduction to Higher-Order
Logics* (2024), Corollary 18.2, shows the maximalizations of C + BF, C + □BF,
C + Actuality, C + □Actuality, C + Atomicity and C + □Atomicity consistent.
`extraction.md` notes these, with Proposition 18.8, Corollaries 18.3–18.4 and
Propositions 18.9–18.11, as awaiting a decision. Recording them would need
relativized Possibility and Distinctness Maximalism principles, one for each base
theory, and it is not yet decided how to present them.

## Further modal principles

*Added 3 October 2026.* Propositional modal axioms not yet on the map, each
closed over $p$ (and $q$):

- **McKinsey (M):** $\forall p\, .\,\Box\Diamond p\to\Diamond\Box p$.
- **Grz:** $\forall p\, .\,\Box(\Box(p\to\Box p)\to p)\to p$.
- **.2 (G):** $\forall p\, .\,\Diamond\Box p\to\Box\Diamond p$.
- **.3:** $\forall p\,q\, .\,\Box(\Box p\to q)\lor\Box(\Box q\to p)$.

Expected connections, to be checked before recording:
- 5 implies .2 and .3.
- M with 5 yields $\Diamond p\to\Box p$, which collapses the modality and conflicts
  with any contingency. 4 is a theorem of C, so B already gives S5, and M with B
  (equivalently ND) collapses too.
- Grz with B likewise collapses, since Grz over S5 forces $p\to\Box p$.
- Their relations to NPC, Atomicity and the existence of worlds need working out,
  as do their boxed forms. With $\Box$ the broadest necessity, boxed and unboxed
  forms may differ.
