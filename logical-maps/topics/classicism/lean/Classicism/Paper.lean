# The paper's symbols

Notation for the pointwise operations at every relational type, so that statements read as
the paper writes them: `X ∧ Y`, `X ∨ Y`, `¬X`, `⊤`, `⊥` for `Rel.and`, `Rel.or`, `Rel.neg`,
`Rel.top`, `Rel.bot`, and `X ≡ Y` for coextension `∀x̄. X[x̄] ↔ Y[x̄]`. (`X ⊆ Y` for the
inclusion `boxImp` is in `Core.lean`, always on.) Everything here is elaboration only: the
terms are the same `Rel` operations as before, so the checker, the quoter and the
translator see exactly what they see without it.

The symbols are the paper's, which subscripts them by type and reads `∧_t` as ordinary
conjunction. Lean's `∧`, `∨` and `¬` are `And`, `Or` and `Not`, and at `Prop` both readings
would type-check, so a plain overload would make every propositional formula ambiguous.
Instead the scope `Classicism.Paper` replaces the three parsers with elaborators that decide
**by type**: at `Prop` they produce `And`, `Or` and `Not`, exactly as core Lean does, and at
any other relational type the `Rel` operation. The type is taken from the expected type
when it is known, else from the first operand whose type is known; when neither is known
the elaboration is postponed, as usual. `⊤` and `⊥` are `True` and `False` at `Prop`. So a
file that says `open Paper` loses nothing at `Prop` and gains the paper's spelling at
every other type; goals print the same way.

This file imports `Lean`, for the elaborators, which `Core.lean` does not; a file that
wants the symbols imports it. Files that open the strict algebra (`Strict/Algebra.lean`)
or import Mathlib should not open the scope, since those have `⊤` and `⊥` of their own.
