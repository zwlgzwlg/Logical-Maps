# Results about the sentence schemas

The map's principles that are schematic in a *sentence* rather than a type — No Pure
Contingency, No Contingency and B for a signature, Distinctness, Possibility, Maximalist
Classicism — are sentence schemas, defined in the metalogical layer
(`Syntax/SentenceSchemas.lean`), and the side conditions of Distinctness and Possibility,
"not a theorem of `C`", "consistent with `C`", are met by exhibiting a model. This folder
holds the map's results about them: what they entail and what they exclude. The
consistency facts from the models that the exclusions rest on are in `../Consistency/`.

Every theorem is over any signature `Sig` where it can be — the pure and the signature
versions of a record are then one theorem — and at `Signature.pure`, where the schemas of
the map's type-indexed principles, `P.schema`, live, where one of those is involved. A certified
lemma of the shallow layer is carried into a signature by `Term.ofPure`
(`Syntax/Pure.lean`), and instantiated at the sentences of the proof by `allEβ` and
`allE₂β`.

| file | contents |
| --- | --- |
| `PossibilityDistinctness.lean` | Distinctness and Possibility are equivalent, relative to any theory over any signature; `Max T` entails both. The one object-level step, `◇(x ≠ y) → x ≠ y`, is a shallow lemma certified once. |
| `Contingency.lean` | No Pure Contingency necessitates every schema of pure sentences, `NPC ∪ Ax ⟹ Ax.box` — the map's twenty `no-pure-contingency-and-X-imply-necessary-X` records as one theorem; the arrows among No Contingency, No Pure Contingency, B for the signature and B for pure sentences; B and the Fregean Axiom as sources. |
| `Incompatibilities.lean` | Possibility, Distinctness and `Max T` refute the necessitation of anything refutable in a model (`possibility_box_inconsistent`); Maximalist Classicism against `ND`, `□`Actuality, `□`Atomicity, `□`Boolean Completeness; Possibility against No Pure Contingency and against B for pure sentences. |

The necessitation of a schema `Ax` is `Ax.box`, so that of a principle's schema is
`AxiomSet.box P.schema`; the two boxed principles the shallow layer states, `□BF_t` and
`□ND_t`, have the schemas `P.NecBarcanT.schema` and `P.NecNecessityOfDistinctnessT.schema`,
and the theorems are stated for them where the record is about them.

## Not yet here, and why

- **Cross-signature arrows**: `possibility-signature-r-implies-possibility-schema-r` and
  `distinctness-signature-r-implies-distinctness-schema-r` need the conservativity of
  `C(Σ)` over `C` for pure sentences, which the map proves through completeness. The
  direction this folder has, `ofPure`, is the other one. A syntactic proof would replace
  the constants of a derivation by fresh variables and discharge them by Existence.
- **Principles not in the shallow layer**: Witnessed Possibility and its kin (substitution
  of constants for variables), Possibility+, Strong Possibility (`◇_≠`), Separated
  Structure, Independence, Modal Freedom, Logical Necessity, the Infinity principles, the
  Necessity of Arithmetic. (Actuality, Boolean Completeness, Atomlessness and Plenitude
  are now in `Principles.lean`, with their shallow records in `Results/Records.lean`.)
- **Models not yet built**: the incompatibilities of Possibility with `□`Strong Leibniz
  (`t`) and `□`Relational Choice need the coalesced sums and a Henkin model without
  choice; with Countable Boolean Completeness, Gödel. The maximalist incompatibilities with
  `□`Functionality and Rigid Comprehension need models refuting those principles; those
  with `□`Actuality, `□`Atomicity and `□`Boolean Completeness come from the permutation
  model of Appendix D (`Models/Permutations.lean`). Parts 2 to 8 (`Models/Monoids.lean`)
  add, in `../Consistency/Consistency.lean`, one section per part: the paper's Proposition D.5 rows, and
  the non-theoremhood of each failing principle from the holding ones (`BF_e` from
  Actuality and Atomicity, Actuality from Atomicity, Atomicity from `BF` and Actuality,
  `ND_e` and Boolean Completeness from all three).
- **`c5-and-atomicity(-t)-imply-no-pure-contingency`**: the automorphism exchanging two
  atoms, extended by conjugation to every type, is a substantial metalogical proof by
  induction on terms.

## What the results depend on

The entailments rest on `propext` and `Quot.sound`, like every certified derivation. The
incompatibilities rest also on what the consistency facts they cite rest on
(`../Consistency/README.md`). `#print axioms` on any theorem reports which.
