# Possibility and Distinctness are equivalent

The map's records `distinctness-schema-r-implies-possibility-schema-r`,
`possibility-schema-r-implies-distinctness-schema-r`, and the same two for the signature
versions, `distinctness-signature-r-implies-possibility-signature-r` and
`possibility-signature-r-implies-distinctness-signature-r` (Classicism, §2.4, pp. 35–36;
§2.5, pp. 37–39). Both schemas are relative to a theory `C ∪ Ax` over a signature `Sig`;
the theorems are proved for any `Sig` and `Ax`, so the pure and the signature records are
the same two theorems, at `Signature.pure` and `empty` or at `Σ` and its axioms.

**Distinctness gives Possibility.** If `P` is consistent with the theory, `P = ⊥` is not
its theorem — else `P` and `P = ⊥` would give `⊥` — so Distinctness has `¬(P = ⊥)`, which
is `◇P` as the map and this layer define it. No object-level reasoning: the two schemas
meet at the sentence.

**Possibility gives Distinctness.** If `A = B` is not a theorem, `A ≠ B` is consistent
(the deduction theorem and excluded middle, `consistent_neg_of_not_theorem`), so
Possibility has `◇(A ≠ B)`; and `◇(A ≠ B) → A ≠ B` is a theorem of Classicism by the
necessity of identity — proved in the shallow layer (`dia_ne_imp_ne`), certified, carried
into the signature (`ofPure`), and applied to `A` and `B` (`allE₂β`).

The maximalization of a theory contains its Distinctness schema, so `Max T` entails both.

/-- What is possibly distinct is distinct: `◇(x ≠ y) → x ≠ y`, the contrapositive of the
necessity of identity. The object-level work is one `simp`: given `x = y`, `x ≠ y` is
`¬(y = y)`, which is `¬⊤`, which is `⊥`. The `eq_self` step is `propext` at the closed
argument `rfl`, Necessitation of `y = y`, which the gate checks at the use site and the
translator turns into Subst. -/
