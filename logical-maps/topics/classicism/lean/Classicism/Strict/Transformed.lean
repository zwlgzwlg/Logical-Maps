# The library, transformed

This module runs the Appendix A transformer over every theorem of the shallow layer, once.
For each theorem `foo : S` that it reaches it declares `foo.nec : S' = ⊤` and
`foo.strict : S'`, from the eleven identities and no `propext` or `funext`; for each
definition whose reading changes, such as `Persistent`, it declares the strict twin. The
kernel checks every one, and `Classicism/Audit.lean` then holds them to the strict check and
the type check.

This is the one home of those declarations. Anything that wants `modal_K.strict` imports
this module; running `#classicism_transform` elsewhere only reports, since the transformer
does not redeclare what exists.

The report lists any theorem not reached, with the reason. Today every theorem is reached
except ten of the equivalences between forms in `Principles/Lattice.lean` and
`Principles/Instances.lean` (Atomicity and Strong Leibniz and their duals), which use the
classical laws of `Pointwise` (`incl_neg_intro`, `incl_neg_neg`): `SPointwise` mirrors
only the class's first eleven laws.
