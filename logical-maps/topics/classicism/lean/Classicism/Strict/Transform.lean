# The transformer: Appendix A as an induction on Lean proof terms

`#classicism_transform foo` takes a theorem `foo : S` proved under the **gate**, where
`propext` and `funext` occur only with closed arguments, and produces, from the eleven
closed identities and no `propext` or `funext` at all,

* `foo.nec : S' = ⊤`, the **necessitation** of `foo`, and
* `foo.strict : S'`,

where `S'` is `S` read in the paper's vocabulary (`True ↦ ⊤`, `False ↦ ⊥`, `→ ↦ imp`,
`↔ ↦ iff`). The kernel checks both, so a bug here yields a rejected declaration, never a
false theorem.

No statement quantifies over types: the type-system check allows a binder over a type
only as a parameter of a declaration, so every theorem is a formula of the paper's
language once its type parameters are fixed, and every theorem has a necessitation. That
is what puts the whole shallow layer within reach of one induction.

## The method

This is Appendix A's `hardlemma`, done as the paper does it: by **induction on the given
proof**, never by re-proving anything. Nothing is decided and nothing is searched for; each
constructor of the proof term has one fixed lemma, and the transform of a proof is those
lemmas composed in the shape of the proof. So a new shallow theorem needs no new strict
work, provided its proof is built from constructors already in the table.

`H` is a Hilbert system and a Lean term is a natural deduction, so the induction hypothesis
is carried in sequent form. For a proof `t : A` in a context with object variables `v̄` and
hypotheses `h₁ : H₁, …, hₙ : Hₙ`, the transform of `t` is a proof of

    (λv̄. Γ → A') = (λv̄. ⊤)          Γ := ⊤ ∧ H₁' ∧ … ∧ Hₙ'

an identity in the algebra `v̄ → Prop` of `Classicism/Algebra.lean`. The cases:

| proof term | what carries the induction |
| --- | --- |
| a hypothesis `hᵢ` | `rule_hyp`, then `rule_weaken` past the later hypotheses |
| `fun h : H => b` | `rule_imp_intro` |
| `f a`, `a` a proof | `rule_imp_elim`, or `rule_not_elim`: Appendix A step (i) |
| `fun u : σ => b` | Distribution-∨∀, the hypothesis under `∀u`, Proposition A.1: step (ii) |
| `f a`, `a` a term | Absorption-∨∀, then `rule_absorb`: case (ii) |
| a constant `c : S` | its necessitation `S' = ⊤`, then `rule_const` |
| gated `propext s` | `s` transformed with `Γ` empty, then Proposition A.3 |
| gated `funext (fun x => s)` | `s` transformed with `x` added to `v̄`; η does the rest |

A library theorem is a constant like any other, its necessitation being its own transform,
made on demand. The core constants (`And.intro`, `Or.elim`, `Eq.refl`, …) have theirs in
`Classicism/Primitives.lean`. Recursors are first restated with their motives instantiated,
as `Prim.ll`, `Prim.and_rec` and so on, so that their types are formulas.

Every step is `congrArg` on a closed identity with β for free, which is Ref and Leibniz's
Law. There is no ξ: nothing is ever proved pointwise and then abstracted.

## Why the gate is exactly the right condition

The `propext` case transforms its argument with `Γ` *empty*, because Equivalence needs
`(λv̄. A ↔ B) = (λv̄. ⊤)` outright, not under hypotheses. That is sound only if the argument
mentions no hypothesis in scope, which is what the gate checks. The natural-deduction
presentation of `C` says the same thing: its special rule has premises `P ⊢ Q` and `Q ⊢ P`
with no side premises.

/-! ### The registry of mirrors

A class such as `Rel` states its laws with `True` and proves them, in its instances, by
gated Equivalence. The strict layer has a **mirror** of each such class, whose laws are
closed identities proved from the axioms (`Classicism/Mirror.lean`). The transformer has to
know which constant mirrors which: the class, its data projections and its instances go in
`mirrorExt`, and each law field's necessitation goes in `necExt`. Both are filled by
commands, so a new class needs a mirror but no change here. -/
