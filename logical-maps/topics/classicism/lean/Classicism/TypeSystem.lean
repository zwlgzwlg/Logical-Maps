# The term-level check: staying inside the relational type system

The gate in `Classicism/Check.lean` verifies two things, that a proof's axioms are
admissible and that Logical Equivalence is never applied to a hypothesis. Neither says
anything about the *type theory* the proof uses. A proof could quantify over `Type`,
recurse over `Nat`, or form a Lean type such as `e → e` that the paper's system `R` does
not admit, and still pass. This file supplies the missing check.

## What `R` is, inside Lean

`R` admits `e`, `t`, and `σ → τ` whenever `τ ≠ e`. So an `R`-type, as a Lean expression,
is `Classicism.e`, or `Prop`, or a *non-dependent* arrow whose domain is an `R`-type and
whose codomain is a relational `R`-type. Dependency is what rules out the rest of Lean's
type theory: `(x : σ) → τ x` is not an `R`-type however `σ` and `τ` behave.

A schema over types is written `∀ {σ : Type} [Ty σ] …`, so a bound type variable is an
`R`-type exactly when the telescope guards it with a `Ty`, `Rel` or `Order` instance.
An unguarded `∀ {σ : Type}` is a genuine quantifier over Lean types and is rejected.

## Three categories of constant

The survey of what the library actually reaches came to 59 core constants, and they fall
into three groups, which is why a whitelist is the right instrument here.

* **Object language.** The logical inductives `And`, `Or`, `Iff`, `Eq`, `Exists`, `True`,
  `False`, with their constructors and recursors, plus `Not`, `Ne` and the derived
  eliminators. These *are* the logical constants of `L`, and their rules are the rules
  of `H`.
* **Leibniz's Law plumbing.** `Eq.mpr`, `Eq.ndrec`, `Eq.subst`, `congrArg`, `congrFun`
  and friends, which `rw`, `calc` and `▸` emit. All are `LL`.
* **Metalanguage.** `Trans` and `instTransEq` from `calc`, `PUnit` from the marker field
  of `Ty`, `outParam`, `id`. These are not object language at all; they are artefacts of
  how the formalisation is written, and they carry no logical content. They are listed
  separately so that the distinction stays visible rather than being smuggled into the
  object-language list.

Anything outside all three, `Nat.rec` above all, is rejected.

/-- Is `n` an artefact of elaboration rather than a declaration anyone wrote? Lean lifts
the proof fields of an instance into `_proof_N` declarations and compiles a `match` into a
`match_N` auxiliary, and it drops instance arguments those do not literally use, so their
*statements* can fall outside `R` even when every use of them is inside it. An
eliminator's `motive` binder is the clearest case: its type is a function into `Prop`
from a proposition, which is metalanguage and not a type of `R` at all.

Inside such a declaration the binder and object-type checks are therefore skipped, and
only the constant whitelist is enforced, which is what still catches a forbidden
recursor. This is the one place where the term check is weaker than the rest. -/
