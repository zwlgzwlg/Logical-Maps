# The metalogical layer: types of the relational type system

This is the first module of the **metalogical layer**, in which the terms of the paper's
object language, their derivations, and their models are objects of Lean, so that
metalogical statements can be made about them: that a schema implies a schema, that a
closed pure sentence is a theorem, that a sentence holds in a model. The shallow and
strict layers state and prove object-language theorems *in* Lean; this layer states
theorems *about* the object language, and is related to the other two by a denotation
that reads its terms as Lean propositions.

The types are the relational type system `R` (Classicism, §1.1): two base types, `e` and
`t`, and `σ → τ` for a type `σ` and a *relational* type `τ`, a relational type being one
that ends in `t`. The definition is the mutual one of Dorr's *Elimination*, Appendix A:
types and terminals, with terminals subsumed under types.

Only these two base types: the type system is not parametrized by a set of base types,
and nonlogical vocabulary enters through a signature of constants instead.

## Type variables

Besides the paper's types there are **type variables**, `Ty.var i`: types about which
nothing is known. A type variable is never relational, so it can be the type of a variable
or the argument type of an arrow but never a codomain. Since application and abstraction
always produce relational types, the only terms of a variable type are variables (and
constants of a signature that gives one that type, which the vectorization theorem rules
out). A type with no type variable is **closed**; the closed types are the paper's, and the
map's schemas range over them.

Type variables are a device of the metalogic. A derivation at a type variable uses
nothing about that type, so it can be carried to any type, and to any *list* of types,
a variable of the type becoming a block of variables (`Syntax/Vectorize.lean`). A type
*parameter*, by contrast, is a variable of Lean, `σ : Ty`, ranging over all types; a
proof of `∀ σ : Ty, …` may split on `σ`, and says nothing about uniformity. The
translator's derivations are uniform, so they can be instantiated at a type variable, and
that is how every certified result gets its list form (`history/VECTORIZATION-PLAN.md`).
