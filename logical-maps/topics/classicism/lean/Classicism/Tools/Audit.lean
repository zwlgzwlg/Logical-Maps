# Audit

Runs the checker over every theorem of the shallow formalization at build time, so that
`lake build` fails if a proof strays outside Classicism. The strict layer has its own
audit, `Classicism/Strict/Audit.lean`.

/-! ### The term-level type-system check

Every theorem of the library must also stay inside the relational type system: no
quantification over Lean types that a `Ty`, `Rel`, `Order` or `Pointwise` instance does
not guard, no type outside `R`, and no constant beyond the logical inductives, the `Eq`
plumbing and the formalisation's own metalanguage. -/
