# Translation of shallow proofs into derivations

The translator. `#classicism_derive foo` reads the proof term of a gated shallow theorem
`foo` and declares

    foo.derivable : ∀ σ' …, Theorem C.axioms(Minus) (foo.quoted σ' …)

a derivation, in the metalogical layer's system, of the sentence the quoter makes of
`foo`'s statement, with the theorem's type parameters read as metalogical ones (`σ' : Ty`, `τ' : RTy`). The kernel
checks it. So, for each theorem it reaches, the chain is two links: a proof in Lean under
the gate of `Classicism/Check.lean`, and a derivation in `H` closed under Subst as an
object of Lean, the translator untrusted.

## What a gated shallow proof is made of

A proof term under the gate is natural-deduction shaped already. Its constants are the
logical inductives' constructors, eliminators and recursors (`And.intro`, `Or.elim`,
`Exists.casesOn`, …), the identity plumbing that `rw` and `▸` emit (`Eq.mpr`, `congrArg`,
`Eq.ndrec`, …), lambdas over hypotheses and over objects, applications, the axioms `em`
and `e_exists`, theorems of this library, and the two gated primitives. Each of the first
kinds is one rule of `Derivable`, or a derived rule of `Derivation.lean`; a cited theorem
is translated once, generically, and cited by name; and the two primitives are where the
gate pays off: `propext h`, whose `h` mentions no hypothesis, is **Subst** at the hole
`P = ⬚` with the two directions of `h` as its premises, and `funext (fun x => h)` is
`substEq`, the induction on the type that carries Subst to identities at every type.
The premises of a Subst are derived at the *logical part* of the axiom set, since that is
what the rule asks; a theorem cited there is lifted into it.

A class law used at a type parameter — `Rel.and_constP_true` at `τ`, `Order.le_iff`,
a law of `Pointwise` — is not an axiom: it is derived once for every object type by
induction on the type, the `Prop` instance's proof the base case and the arrow instance's
the step (`ensureFieldInduction`).

## Conversion

Lean's kernel converts silently; the object language has the rule `conv`. Where a term's
quotation and the quotation of its type differ by βηδ, the translator supplies the
conversion, checked by the verified normalizer of `Normalize.lean` through its untyped
shadow of the syntax.

/-! ### Shadows written back

A shadow carries the types of its binders and applications so that it can be written
back as syntax, `toTerm`: the induction on the type needs the unfolding of an operation
as a term, and the step case's statement is assembled from shadows. Two other designs of
the conversion certificate were tried and measured slower than `Conv.of_nf` on a whole
formula: explicit β- and η-steps for every pass, which write out every intermediate term
and cost more in the kernel and the elaborator both; and `Conv.of_nf` only at the
subterms where two shadows differ, joined by congruence, which leaves the kernel to
compare the original term with the shadow written back, two shapes it unfolds lazily
against each other, its slowest path. -/
