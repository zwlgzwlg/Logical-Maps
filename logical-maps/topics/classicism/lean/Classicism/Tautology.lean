# `boolean_eq`: deciding propositional identities strictly

This is the propositional case of Appendix A, as a tactic. Given a goal `P = Q` where `P`
and `Q` are built from propositional atoms by `∧`, `∨`, `¬`, `⊤` and `⊥`, and are
tautologically equivalent, `boolean_eq` produces a proof **from the six Boolean Identities
alone**. It emits no `propext`, no `funext`, and no `em`, so `#classicism_strict` accepts
everything it builds. If `P` and `Q` are not equivalent it reports a falsifying assignment.

## The method: Shannon expansion

The recursion is on the list of atoms, and it is driven by the cancellation lemma already
in `Classicism/Strict.lean`,

    eq_of_meet_eq :  (a ∧ P) = (a ∧ Q)  →  (¬a ∧ P) = (¬a ∧ Q)  →  P = Q

which is where associativity came from too. To prove `P = Q`, pick an atom `a` and prove
the two conjoined equations. Each of those is settled by *substituting for `a`*: under the
conjunct `a` the formula `P` may have every occurrence of `a` replaced by `⊤`, and under
`¬a` by `⊥`. That is `substLit` below, and it leaves a formula with one fewer atom, so the
recursion terminates. With no atoms left, a formula is built from `⊤` and `⊥` only, and
`evalClosed` collapses it to one of them by the bound laws.

So the shape of a produced proof, for atoms `a, b`, is a binary tree of depth two whose
four leaves are each `⊤ = ⊤` or `⊥ = ⊥`. That is exponential in the number of atoms, which
is the right cost for a complete method and no trouble at the sizes that occur here.

## Why substitution needs a lemma about negation

`substLit` recurses on the formula. Conjunction and disjunction are easy, because a
conjunct distributes into both: `meet_meet_split` and `meet_join_distrib`. Negation is the
interesting case, since from `l ∧ Q = l ∧ Q'` one cannot simply conclude
`l ∧ ¬Q = l ∧ ¬Q'` by congruence. The bridge is `relative_compl`,

    l ∧ ¬q  =  l ∧ ¬(l ∧ q)

which says that under `l` the complement of `q` and of `l ∧ q` agree, so the recursive
equation can be applied inside and then the lemma used again in reverse.

## How a tactic is put together

Three layers, each a plain function in `MetaM` returning a *proof term*:

* `evalClosed e` returns which bound `e` is, and a proof of `e = ⊤` or `e = ⊥`.
* `substLit` returns the substituted formula and a proof of `l ∧ P = l ∧ P'`.
* `proveEq` ties them together with `eq_of_meet_eq`.

Nothing here is trusted. `proveEq` hands the kernel a term, and if any of this code is
wrong the term fails to typecheck and the tactic errors; it cannot produce a false theorem.
The front end `boolean_eq` reads the goal, collects the atoms and assigns the result.

Appendix A shows every `H` axiom identical to `⊤` and every rule to preserve that, and
then converts `(P ↔ Q) = ⊤` into `P = Q`. The last step is `eq_of_iff_eq_top` below, and
with the tactic it is four lines: conjoin `⊤` to each side, replace it by the biconditional,
and observe that `P ∧ (P ↔ Q)` and `Q ∧ (P ↔ Q)` are tautologically identical.

Together with `boolean_eq`, which settles any tautology, this closes the `PC` case: a
propositional `H`-theorem `P ↔ Q` yields the identity `P = Q` from the six Boolean
Identities. What remains for stage three is the quantifier part, `UI`, `EG`, `Gen` and
`Inst`, from the five Classicist Identities. -/
