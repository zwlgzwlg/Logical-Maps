# Tame Rigidity ∧ BF ⇒ □BF

## Premises

- **Tame Rigidity.** Every weakly rigid relation, including a proposition, is rigid.
- **BF.** The Barcan Formula at every type. The predicate formulation closes the formula schema using lambda abstraction.

## Conclusion

- **□BF.** Necessarily, the Barcan Formula holds at every type. The predicate formulation closes the formula schema using lambda abstraction.

## Proof

Apply Tame Rigidity at the type tuple $\bar\sigma$ to $Y:=\lambda\bar x\, .\,\top$. $\operatorname{Persistent}(Y)$ is $Y\le\lambda\bar x\, .\,\Box\top$, a theorem. Since $Y\le X$ is $\Box\forall\bar x\, .\,X[\bar x]$, $\operatorname{WeaklyInextensible}(Y)$ unfolds to $\forall X\, .\, (\forall\bar x\, .\,\Box X[\bar x])\to\Box\forall\bar x\, .\,X[\bar x]$, which is BF at $\bar\sigma$, and $\operatorname{Inextensible}(Y)$ is its necessitation. So BF makes $Y$ weakly rigid, Tame Rigidity makes it rigid, and its inextensibility is $\Box$BF at $\bar\sigma$. This for every type tuple gives the result.

## Notes

Tame Rigidity applied to the top relation: weak inextensibility of $\top$ is BF and its inextensibility is $\Box$BF. With it the map derives the failure of Tame Rigidity in finite-support-two-object-all-maps, where BF holds and $\Box$BF fails.
