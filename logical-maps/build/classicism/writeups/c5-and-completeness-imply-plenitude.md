# □ND ∧ Boolean Completeness ⇒ Plenitude

## Premises

- **□ND.** Necessarily, distinct things of any type are necessarily distinct.
- **Boolean Completeness.** Every property of entities of a relational type has a greatest lower bound in that type.

## Conclusion

- **Plenitude.** Every total single-valued binary relation is represented by an operation. Its output type is relational, as required by the type system.

## Proof

For functional U with propositional output, take the least upper bound G of all operations X such that Xy entails the unique U-output at y. Fix a and its output p. The operation $\lambda x\, .\,x=a\land p$ lies below G, by ND, so p entails Ga. The operation $\lambda x\, .\,x\ne a\lor p$ is an upper bound of the same family: ND gives the pointwise comparison and BF promotes it to entailment. Therefore Ga entails p. Antisymmetry gives Ga=p. For relational outputs the argument is applied to their finite argument tuples as in the source; all output types are relational.
