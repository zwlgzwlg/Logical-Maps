## Premises

- **Boolean Completeness.** Every property of entities of a relational type has a greatest lower bound in that type.
- **Actuality.** There is a true proposition that entails every true proposition.

## Conclusion

- **Weak Rigid Comprehension.** Every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a weakly rigid one, that is, with one that is persistent and weakly inextensible.

## Proof

Fix a relational type $\tau=\bar\sigma t$ and $X^\tau$. Write $\operatorname{Haec}_{\bar u}:=\lambda\bar z\, .\,\bigwedge_i z_i=u_i$ and put $H:=\lambda Z^\tau\, .\,\exists\bar y\, .\,X[\bar y]\land Z=\operatorname{Haec}_{\bar y}$, the property of being the haecceity of some $X$ things. By Boolean Completeness in its least-upper-bound form, let $Y$ be a least upper bound of $H$. Two observations do the work. (i) If $X[\bar u]$ then $\operatorname{Haec}_{\bar u}\le_\tau Y$, and instantiating at $\bar u$ with $\bar u=\bar u$ gives $\Box Y[\bar u]$. (ii) If $\Box Z[\bar u]$ whenever $X[\bar u]$, then $\operatorname{Haec}_{\bar u}\le_\tau Z$ for each such $\bar u$, so $Z$ is an upper bound of $H$ and $Y\le_\tau Z$.

Coextensiveness. $X[\bar u]\to Y[\bar u]$ by (i). Conversely, let $w$ witness Actuality and put $P:=\lambda\bar z\, .\,(w\le X[\bar z])$. If $X[\bar u]$ then $X[\bar u]$ is true, so $w\le X[\bar u]$; a true entailment is necessary, so $\Box P[\bar u]$. By (ii), $Y\le_\tau P$, so $Y[\bar u]\to w\le X[\bar u]$; and $w$ is true, so $Y[\bar u]\to X[\bar u]$.

Persistence. Take $Z:=\lambda\bar z\, .\,\Box Y[\bar z]$ in (ii). If $X[\bar u]$ then $\Box Y[\bar u]$ by (i), hence $\Box Z[\bar u]$ by 4. So $Y\le_\tau\lambda\bar z\, .\,\Box Y[\bar z]$, which is $\operatorname{Persistent}(Y)$.

Weak inextensibility. Suppose $\forall\bar z\, .\,Y[\bar z]\to\Box Z[\bar z]$. If $X[\bar u]$ then $Y[\bar u]$ by coextensiveness, so $\Box Z[\bar u]$; hence $Y\le_\tau Z$ by (ii).

## Notes

The argument stops short of Rigid Comprehension exactly at the leading box of Inextensible. It delivers a $Y$ that is inextensible at the actual world, while Rigid demands the biconditional at every world. The models recorded from the same draft show that the gap is real.
