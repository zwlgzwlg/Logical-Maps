# Symmetric ideally-full model: arrows omitting a fixed individual

<p class='cert'>Model — Source: BC does not imply RC (draft); produced by Cian Dorr; recorded by Claude Opus 5 (Anthropic), 19 September 2026.</p>

## Package

- **Actuality.** There is a true proposition that entails every true proposition.
- **Boolean Completeness.** Every property of entities of a relational type has a greatest lower bound in that type.
- **No Pure Contingency.** Each closed sentence of the pure language, if true, is necessary. This is a sentence schema, not a quantifier over propositions.
- **Axiom of Infinity (type e).** There are not finitely many individuals. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **Axiom of Infinity (type t).** There are not finitely many propositions. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **Distinctness-preserving collapse.** Every truth is necessary under the distinctness-preserving modality.
- **□Boolean Completeness.** Necessarily, every property of entities of a relational type has a greatest lower bound in that type.
- **□Actuality.** Necessarily, there is a true proposition that entails every true proposition.
- **¬ BF.** The Barcan Formula at every type. The predicate formulation closes the formula schema using lambda abstraction.
- **¬ Independence (signature Σ).** No constant of Sigma is a pure operation applied to other constants: for a closed pure term A and distinct constants c, d_1,…,d_n with n ≥ 0, c differs from A applied to the d’s. With n = 0, no constant denotes a pure entity.
- **¬ B for sentences of Σ.** The B instance for every closed sentence of the language of the fixed signature Sigma.
- **¬ Relational Choice.** Every serial binary relation has a functional subrelation.
- **¬ BF (type t).** BF (type t) in the displayed closed propositional formulation.
- **¬ Atomicity (type t).** Atomicity (type t) in the displayed closed propositional formulation.
- **¬ ND.** Distinct things of any type are necessarily distinct.
- **¬ Witnessed Possibility.** For pure-formulas P with free variables among a finite tuple x, and distinct matching nonlogical constants c, a witness to P entails that P at those constants is possible.
- **¬ Separated Structure.** For each typed nonlogical constant c and closed same-typed terms F,G not containing c, equality after application to c implies equality of F and G.
- **¬ Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ).** The Distinctness Maximalism schema for the fixed nonlogical signature Sigma.
- **¬ No Contingency (signature Σ).** Each closed sentence of the language of the fixed signature Sigma, if true, is necessary. A sentence schema, standing to No Pure Contingency as Possibility Maximalism (signature Σ) stands to Possibility Maximalism (pure).

## Definition

A symmetric ideally-full intensional action model over one object, the set of natural numbers. Its symmetry group is the permutations fixing a distinguished individual, and its arrows are those permutations together with all the functions that omit the distinguished individual from their range. The evaluation point is the identity arrow.

Interpretation of Σ, fixed for this record: one designated relational constant $c$ of type $\tau=\bar\sigma t$ denotes $\lambda\bar x\, .\,a$, where $a$ is the unique true atom of the model, the actual-world proposition, the symmetry group; every other relational constant denotes the top element of its type and every individual constant one fixed individual.

## Arguments

### Holds Actuality.

The two classes are told apart by an arrow's value at that individual, so the symmetry group is a finitely pinned proposition and Actuality holds.

*By Cian Dorr, 2026-09-19.*

### Holds Boolean Completeness.

By the draft's main theorem with the distinguished individual as the distinguished set. Moving points off a finite set can be done by a permutation fixing that individual, and two arrows agreeing there are either both permutations or both range-deficient, so a prescription taken from the two of them extends by nonzero values to an arrow of the same kind.

*By Cian Dorr, 2026-09-19.*

### Holds No Pure Contingency.

One object gives No Pure Contingency and the boxed forms.

*By Cian Dorr, 2026-09-19.*

### Fails BF.

At type e. Take the property of being positive unless things are as they actually are, which is pinned down by the distinguished individual and is symmetric. Every individual necessarily has it, since an arrow either fixes the distinguished individual or omits it from its range and so sends everything to something positive; but it is not necessary that everything has it, since any arrow moving the distinguished individual leaves it out.

*By Cian Dorr, 2026-09-19.*

### Holds Axiom of Infinity (type e), Axiom of Infinity (type t).

The individuals are the natural numbers and identity at the identity arrow is literal, so no numeral counts them. The propositions that a given individual is fixed by the arrow, one for each individual, are pairwise distinct, symmetric and pinned by that individual, so there are infinitely many propositions. The set of numerals at each type is invariant under every arrow, hence symmetric and pinned by the empty set, so finite cardinality is standard and no finite cardinality holds of the universal property at either type.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-09-20.*

### Fails Independence (signature Σ), B for sentences of Σ.

No Contingency (signature Σ) fails, since the Σ-sentence $\forall\bar x\, .\,c\bar x$ denotes $a$, true and contingent; B for sentences of Σ fails, since under any arrow that no arrow composes back into $a$, $\Diamond a$ is false, so $\Box\Diamond a$ fails; Witnessed Possibility fails for the pure formula $x=\top_\tau$, witnessed by $\top_\tau$, since $\Diamond(c=\top_\tau)$ is $\Diamond\Box a$ and $a$ is necessary at no arrow; Separated Structure fails with it, being equivalent to Possibly Witnessed Possibility; Independence (signature Σ) and Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ) fail through the other relational constants, Σ being assumed to contain at least one: such a constant $c'$ of type $\tau'$ denotes what the closed pure term $\top_{\tau'}$ denotes, and $c'=\top_{\tau'}$ is a true identity that C(Σ) does not prove. The designated constant refutes neither: closed pure terms denote entities fixed by every arrow (Classicism, §3.5, p. 58), whereas $a$ is fixed by no arrow but the identity, so no closed pure term denotes $\lambda\bar x\, .\,a$. Everything that implies these fails with them.

*Address: `symmetric-range-gap#sigma-true-atom`. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr’s request, 2026-09-22.*

*Revised 2026-09-23 by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic):* Re-fixed the interpretation of Σ so as to settle No Contingency (signature Σ) and B for sentences of Σ, at Cian Dorr’s request.

*Revised 2026-09-23 by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic):* Corrected the reason given for the failures of Independence (signature Σ) and Distinctness (signature Σ): the true atom is denoted by no closed pure term, since such terms denote entities fixed by every arrow; the failures come from the other relational constants, which denote top. No verdict changes.

### Holds Distinctness-preserving collapse.

Let $a$ be the set of arrows that are permutations, a symmetric proposition true at the identity and, as the record’s Actuality witness, entailed by no other truth. For a true $p$, $a\le p$. Take $q:=a$: under a permutation $i$, $p$ holds since $i\in a\subseteq p$; under a non-permutation $i$, $\Diamond a$ would need $k\circ i$ to be a permutation, which no composite with an arrow omitting the distinguished individual from its range is, since the other arrows fix that individual and so cannot restore it to the range. So every truth is $\Box_{\ne}$-necessary.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-23.*

### Fails Relational Choice.

At the types $(e\to t)$ and $e$. Let $U:=\lambda Xy\, .\,Xy\lor\neg\exists z\, .\,Xz$, a closed term, hence in the domain, and serial. A functional subrelation $S$ of $U$ would lie in the domain at the evaluation object, so it is symmetric and pinned down by a finite set $N$. Two facts about such an $S$ (Dorr, draft, Lemma 21): every $g\in G$ fixing $N$ pointwise satisfies $g^{[\sigma]}S=S$, and symmetry gives $\langle gA,gy,g\rangle\in S$ whenever $\langle A,y,1\rangle\in S$; together, $\langle gA,gy,1\rangle\in S$. Now let $A$ be the property of not belonging to $N\cup\{0\}$. It is in the domain, being pinned down by that finite set and symmetric, and its extension is nonempty, so $S$ relates $A$ at the identity to some $y$ in its extension. The transposition of $y$ with another individual outside $N\cup\{0\}$ fixes $0$, so lies in $G$, fixes $A$ and moves $y$ to some $gy\ne y$, so $S$ relates $A$ to $gy$ as well, and $S$ is not functional at the identity arrow. The well-ordering of the individuals that Cian Dorr had in mind is refuted by the same two facts, but the direct route needs no derivation of a well-ordering from Relational Choice in C.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), after Cian Dorr’s observation that a choice over the individuals cannot be finitely pinned down, 2026-09-23.*

### Fails BF (type t).

In a one-object finitely pinned model, BF (type t) fails as soon as there are a finite $N$, an arrow $i$ and a proposition $q$ in the domain that is the transport $i^{\prime}\cdot p=\{k : k\circ i^{\prime}\in p\}$ of no proposition $p$ along any arrow $i^{\prime}$ agreeing with $i$ on $N$: the intension $X:=\{\langle r,j\rangle : r\ne q\text{ or }j\text{ disagrees with }i\text{ on }N\}$ is pinned down by $N$, contains $\langle i^{\prime}\cdot p,i^{\prime}\rangle$ for every $p$ and $i^{\prime}$, so $\forall p\, .\,\Box Xp$ holds at the identity, and omits $\langle q,i\rangle$, so $\Box\forall p\, .\,Xp$ fails there. Since membership of $k$ in $i^{\prime}\cdot p$ depends only on $k$ restricted to the range of $i^{\prime}$, it suffices that $q$ separate two arrows agreeing on every such range. Here take $N=\{0\}$, $i$ any arrow with $i0\ne0$, so that every arrow agreeing with it on $N$ omits $0$ from its range, and $q:=\{k : k0=0\}$, the symmetry group, pinned down by $\{0\}$ and symmetric: a permutation $k$ fixing $0$ and the arrow $k^{\prime}$ agreeing with it off $0$ but sending $0$ elsewhere, which omits $0$ from its range, are separated by $q$. The intension $X$ is symmetric, since $g\cdot q=q$ for $g$ fixing $0$ and $(g\circ j)0=0$ iff $j0=0$, so it lies in the domain.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), answering Cian Dorr’s question whether the failure of BF sharpens to type $t$, 2026-09-23.*

### Fails Atomicity (type t).

The symmetry group is an atom, but no atom lies inside the nonempty proposition $T$ of arrows omitting $0$ from their range, which is symmetric and pinned down by $\{0\}$: a nonempty symmetric $p\subseteq T$ pinned down by $N\ni0$ and containing $h$ contains every arrow in $T$ whose restriction to $N$ has the same fibres as $h$’s, and those whose restriction to $N\cup\{m\}$ has the same fibres as $h$’s form a smaller nonempty symmetric proposition pinned down by $N\cup\{m\}$, since $h$’s value at a fresh $m$ can be made to coincide with, or to differ from, a value on $N$.

## Notes

The first of the draft's two variants in which BF is made to fail. Actuality and the range deficiency come from the same finite test here, which is what the next variant prises apart. Atomicity and Rigid Comprehension are not settled in the draft and are left unknown. The source is a work in progress.
ND fails at type e because the range-deficient arrows include non-injective ones; the draft does not draw that consequence separately. Argument of 23 September 2026, after Cian Dorr’s observation that a choice over the individuals cannot be finitely pinned down; the well-ordering of the individuals that he had in mind is refuted by the same two facts, but the direct route needs no derivation of a well-ordering from Relational Choice in C. Observation of 23 September 2026, answering Cian Dorr’s question whether the failure of BF sharpens to type $t$. Atomicity fails already at type $t$, although Actuality holds.

The record's revision log before it was written as arguments.

- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Recorded the Distinctness-preserving collapse; see the notes. Now satisfies: Distinctness-preserving collapse.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Re-fixed the interpretation of Σ so as to settle No Contingency (signature Σ) and B for sentences of Σ, at Cian Dorr’s request; see the notes. Now violates: No Contingency (signature Σ), B for sentences of Σ.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Corrected the reason given for the failures of Independence (signature Σ) and Distinctness (signature Σ): the true atom is denoted by no closed pure term, since such terms denote entities fixed by every arrow; the failures come from the other relational constants, which denote top. No verdict changes.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Recorded the failure of Relational Choice, at types (e→t) and e: a functional subrelation of the serial relation pairing each property with its members would be symmetric and finitely pinned, and a symmetry fixing its pinning set would carry its choice for the property of lying outside that set to a second choice. Cian Dorr’s observation that a choice cannot be finitely pinned; argument in the notes. Now violates: Relational Choice.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Recorded the failure of BF at type t, sharpening the failure of BF; argument in the notes. Now violates: BF (type t).
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Recorded the failure of Atomicity (type t), and with it of the Strong Leibniz Biconditionals; see the notes. Now violates: Atomicity (type t).
- **2026-09-22** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Fixed an interpretation of Σ (relational constants as top, individual constants as one fixed individual) and recorded the signature schemata it refutes, at Cian Dorr’s request. Now violates: Witnessed Possibility, Separated Structure, Independence (signature Σ), Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ).
- **2026-09-20** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added both Axioms of Infinity at Cian Dorr's direction. The individuals are the natural numbers and identity at the identity arrow is literal, so no numeral counts them. The propositions that a given individual is fixed by the arrow, one for each individual, are pairwise distinct, symmetric and pinned by that individual, so there are infinitely many propositions. The set of numerals at each type is invariant under every arrow, hence symmetric and pinned by the empty set, so finite cardinality is standard and no finite cardinality holds of the universal property at either type. Now satisfies: Axiom of Infinity (type e), Axiom of Infinity (type t).
