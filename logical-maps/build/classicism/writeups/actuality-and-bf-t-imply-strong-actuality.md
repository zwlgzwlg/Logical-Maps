# Actuality ∧ BF (type t) ⇒ Strong Actuality

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Misc., Lean `Classicism.Map.actuality_and_bf_t_imply_strong_actuality`; produced by Cian Dorr, 6 October 2026 (statement); proof written out by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic); recorded by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), 6 October 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **Actuality.** There is a true proposition that entails every true proposition.
- **BF (type t).** BF (type t) in the displayed closed propositional formulation.

## Conclusion

- **Strong Actuality.** There is a true strong world proposition: a true proposition that necessarily entails every proposition or its negation.

## Proof

Let $a$ witness Actuality. For each $q$, $a\le q\lor a\le\neg q$: if $q$ is true, $a\le q$; if not, $\neg q$ is true and $a\le\neg q$. Each disjunct is necessary by 4, so the disjunction is necessary: $\forall q\, .\,\Box(a\le q\lor a\le\neg q)$. BF (type t), for the property $\lambda q\, .\,a\le q\lor a\le\neg q$, gives $\Box\forall q\, .\,a\le q\lor a\le\neg q$. With $a$ true, $a$ witnesses Strong Actuality. (The argument of Bacon's Exercise 8.12 for the Strong Leibniz Biconditionals, applied to the actual-world proposition.)
