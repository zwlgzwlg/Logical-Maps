## Premises

- **Vicinity.** There is a true proposition that entails the possibility of each true proposition.
- **Weakly Inextensible Comprehension.** Every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a weakly inextensible one.

## Conclusion

- **Actuality.** There is a true proposition that entails every true proposition.

## Proof

Let $w$ witness Vicinity. Weakly Inextensible Comprehension at type $t\to t$, applied to $X:=\lambda p\, .\,p$, gives a weakly inextensible $F$ with $\forall p\, .\,Fp\leftrightarrow p$. Put $a:=w\land\forall p\, .\,p\leftrightarrow Fp$, which is true. Fix a true $q$; we show $a\le q$. Let $Z_q:=\lambda p\, .\,w\to\Diamond(q\land p)$. If $Fp$ then $p$ is true, so $q\land p$ is true and Vicinity gives $w\le\Diamond(q\land p)$, which is $\Box Z_q\,p$. Hence $\forall p\, .\,Fp\to\Box Z_q\,p$, and weak inextensibility gives $F\le Z_q$, that is $\Box\forall p\, .\,Fp\to(w\to\Diamond(q\land p))$. Instantiate at $p:=\neg q$: since $\Diamond(q\land\neg q)=\Diamond\bot=\bot$, this is $\Box\neg(w\land F\neg q)$. The formula $a\land\neg q\to w\land F\neg q$ is a theorem, so by necessitation and K, $\Box\neg(a\land\neg q)$, which is $a\le q$. So $a$ witnesses Actuality.

## Notes

Only the type-$(t\to t)$ instance of Weakly Inextensible Comprehension at $X=\lambda p\, .\,p$ is used. Unlike the derivation of Weakly Inextensible Comprehension from Actuality, the argument uses the box in the antecedent of weak inextensibility, and Vicinity is what supplies it. With that derivation and Actuality ⇒ Vicinity, Actuality is equivalent to Vicinity together with Weakly Inextensible Comprehension. Since the implication is a theorem of C, its necessitation also holds, but the map has no record of necessary Weakly Inextensible Comprehension.
