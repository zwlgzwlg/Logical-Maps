## Package

- **Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ).** The Distinctness Maximalism schema for the fixed nonlogical signature Sigma.
- **Axiom of Infinity (type e).** There are not finitely many individuals. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **Relational Choice.** Every serial binary relation has a functional subrelation.
- **Actuality.** There is a true proposition that entails every true proposition.
- **Distinctness-preserving collapse.** Every truth is necessary under the distinctness-preserving modality.
- **¬ Possibility+ (pure).** The strengthened Possibility Maximalism schema for pure C-consistent formulas whose only free variables are the displayed individual variables; include the empty tuple.
- **¬ Tame Rigidity.** Every weakly rigid relation, including a proposition, is rigid.
- **¬ Intensional Choice.** If a property is necessarily instantiated, then some property entailing it is necessarily uniquely instantiated.
- **¬ BF (type t).** BF (type t) in the displayed closed propositional formulation.
- **¬ Atomicity (type t).** Atomicity (type t) in the displayed closed propositional formulation.
- **¬ Boolean Completeness (type t).** Boolean Completeness (type t) in the displayed closed propositional formulation.
- **¬ □Vicinity.** Necessarily, there is a true proposition that entails the possibility of each true proposition.
- **¬ □Weakly Inextensible Comprehension.** Necessarily, every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a weakly inextensible one.
- **¬ □Transversal.** Necessarily, there is a property of properties that picks out exactly one property from each coextension class, that is, exactly one property coextensive with any given property.

## Definition

Take a coalesced sum of a set of source action models complete for C in the fixed signature, evaluated at the new root. See Definition E.2 for the construction.

Root domains are as full as compatibility allows: a root proposition is a choice, for each component, of a proposition of that component’s root domain, together with a truth value at the root’s identity arrow, and a root entity of a relational type is likewise a family of component entities with a root component that is an arbitrary function of the root arguments.

*A member of the group Coalesced sums at a new root, which supplies this definition with the record's settings, and the arguments marked as shared.*

## Arguments

### Holds Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ).

*Source: Classicism, Theorem 3.26, §3.6, pp. 62–64. By Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr, 2026-09-17.*

### Holds Axiom of Infinity (type e).

The root individuals are all families of component individuals, infinitely many since components have arbitrarily many individuals; identity at the root is identity of families; and the property of cardinalities that is true of exactly the standard numerals at the root and universal in every component is a root entity, so a finite cardinality at the root is a standard numeral, and no standard numeral holds of the universal property over an infinite domain.

*By Cian Dorr, recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-22.*

### Fails Possibility+ (pure).

Some component $N$ satisfies necessarily that there are at least three individuals, since that sentence is consistent; take two root individuals that differ at $N$ and agree everywhere else; the pure formula saying that $x\ne y$ and there are exactly two individuals is consistent, but at the root there are infinitely many individuals, under every arrow into another component the two collapse, and under every arrow into $N$ there are at least three.

*By Cian Dorr, recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-22.*

### Fails Tame Rigidity.

Tame Rigidity fails at a relational argument type in models of C (ultralimit-fork, symmetric-qualitative-links), so some component $M$ refutes it at its root $M_0$: some $F_M$ of type $\sigma\to t$, $\sigma$ relational, is weakly rigid there but not rigid. A root entity $F$ of that type is a root extension $F_o$ together with a component $F_N$ in each component $N$, and a formula about $F$ at a world of $N$ is the same formula about $F_N$ in $N$. Since the components of root entities are arbitrary, $F$ is weakly inextensible at the root exactly when, for every $N$, every $X_N$ that necessarily holds of the $N$-components of the members of $F_o$ has $F_N\le X_N$. For each other component $N$ fix $z_N$, and for each $y$ in the extension of $F_M$ at $M_0$ let $x_y$ be the root entity with $M$-component $y$ and $N$-components $z_N$, free at the root by the condition. Put $F_o:=\{x_y\}$, $F_N:=\lambda y\, .\,y=z_N$, a haecceity, rigid in every model of C, and keep $F_M$. Then $F$ is persistent and weakly inextensible at the root, each component's condition being the weak inextensibility of its own component, but not inextensible, since $F_M$ is not inextensible in $M$ and every arrow from the root into $M$ factors through the distinguished one. So Tame Rigidity fails at the root.

*From the group *Coalesced sums at a new root*, shared argument `coalesced-sums#tame-rigidity-component`. It requires that The components are a family of action models complete for C: every sentence consistent with C is true at the root of some component. Here: The source action models are a set complete for C. It requires that A root entity of a relational type has a root component that is an arbitrary function of the root arguments. Here: The root domains are as full as compatibility allows. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), answering Cian Dorr's conjecture, 2026-10-03.*

*Revised 2026-10-03 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* One direction of Fable's transfer theorem: at a coalesced root, Tame Rigidity at a relational type holds iff it holds at the root of every component. The other direction is not recorded, the engine deriving the positive verdict in the one model where it applies.

### Fails Intensional Choice.

The type-$e$ instance of Intensional Choice fails in a model of C (symmetric-all-surjections), so its negation is consistent with C and some component $M$ refutes it at its root $M_0$: some $F$ in $M_0$'s domain is necessarily instantiated and no $G\le F$ there is necessarily uniquely instantiated. As in barcan-t-component, the thread $F^{\prime}$ that is universal at the root and in every other component and is carried onto $F$ by the distinguished arrow to $M_0$ is in the root domain, and it is necessarily instantiated. A root $G\le F^{\prime}$ that is necessarily uniquely instantiated would be carried onto such a $G$ for $F$ at $M_0$, every arrow from the root into $M$ factoring through the distinguished one. So the unboxed principle fails at the root.

*From the group *Coalesced sums at a new root*, shared argument `coalesced-sums#intensional-choice-component`. It requires that The components are a family of action models complete for C: every sentence consistent with C is true at the root of some component. Here: The source action models are a set complete for C. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's suggestion, 2026-10-03.*

### Holds Relational Choice.

The functionality of a subrelation is evaluated at the root’s identity arrow only, while the subrelation condition is boxed; so for a serial root relation take the subrelation whose root component is a functional choice from the root component, by choice in the metatheory, and whose component parts are empty. Where some component refutes Relational Choice at its root, as when the components are complete for C, its necessitation fails.

*From the group *Coalesced sums at a new root*, shared argument `coalesced-sums#relational-choice-free-root`. It requires that A root entity of a relational type has a root component that is an arbitrary function of the root arguments. Here: The root domains are as full as compatibility allows. By Cian Dorr, recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-22.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The three complete members' copies stated once; "Its necessitation fails, since some component refutes Relational Choice at its root" became conditional on that, since in the all-finite-domains member every component satisfies Relational Choice.

### Holds Actuality.

The singleton root proposition witnesses Actuality.

*Source: Classicism, Appendix E, p. 83. From the group *Coalesced sums at a new root*, shared argument `coalesced-sums#actuality-singleton-root`. By Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr, 2026-09-17.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The three members' versions stated once.

### Fails BF (type t).

C is complete for the component set, so some component $M$ refutes BF at its root $M_0$, at type $t$ say: some $F$ in $M_0$’s domain has $\forall y\, .\,\Box Fy$ true and $\Diamond\exists y\, .\,\neg Fy$ true at $M_0$. Because the root’s domains are as full as possible, the thread $F^{\prime}$ that is universal at the root and in every other component and is carried onto $F$ by the distinguished arrow to $M_0$ is in the root domain. Every arrow from the root into $M$ factors through that distinguished arrow, so $\forall y\, .\,\Box F^{\prime}y$ at the root reduces to $\forall y\, .\,\Box Fy$ at $M_0$ together with trivial checks elsewhere, and $\Diamond\exists y\, .\,\neg F^{\prime}y$ at the root follows from $\Diamond\exists y\, .\,\neg Fy$ at $M_0$ through the same factorization.

*From the group *Coalesced sums at a new root*, shared argument `coalesced-sums#barcan-t-component`. It requires that The components are a family of action models complete for C: every sentence consistent with C is true at the root of some component. Here: The source action models are a set complete for C. By Cian Dorr, recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-22.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The three members' verbatim copies stated once.

### Fails Atomicity (type t).

C is complete for the components, so some component $M$ refutes Atomicity at its root, by a proposition $p_M$ with no atom below it in $M$’s domain; the root proposition that is $p_M$ on $M$, empty on every other component and false at the root has as its root lower bounds exactly the root propositions that are lower bounds of $p_M$ on $M$ and empty elsewhere, so it has no atom below it either.

*From the group *Coalesced sums at a new root*, shared argument `coalesced-sums#atomicity-t-component`. It requires that The components are a family of action models complete for C: every sentence consistent with C is true at the root of some component. Here: The source action models are a set complete for C. By Cian Dorr, recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-22.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The three members' verbatim copies stated once.

### Fails Boolean Completeness (type t).

The truncation model of Appendix D, part 6, refutes it at type $t$, as its record now shows, and the components are complete for C, so one of them does; the root propositions false at every arrow except those into that component form a copy of its propositional domain under the root’s entailment order, and a root property of propositions holding exactly of the copies of the members of that component’s counterexample family has no least upper bound at the root.

*From the group *Coalesced sums at a new root*, shared argument `coalesced-sums#boolean-completeness-t-component`. It requires that The components are a family of action models complete for C: every sentence consistent with C is true at the root of some component. Here: The source action models are a set complete for C. By Cian Dorr, recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-23.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The three members' verbatim copies stated once.

### Fails □Vicinity, □Weakly Inextensible Comprehension.

The components are complete for C and a closed pure sentence at the distinguished arrow into a component has its truth value at that component root, so every pure sentence consistent with C is possible at the root; the negation of Vicinity is consistent (the truncation model) and so is the negation of a closed instance of Weakly Inextensible Comprehension at type $t\to t$ (the permutation model). Since □Actuality fails here while Vicinity and Weakly Inextensible Comprehension hold, the boxed results show that at least one of the boxed principles had to fail.

*From the group *Coalesced sums at a new root*, shared argument `coalesced-sums#pure-sentences-possible`. It requires that The components are a family of action models complete for C: every sentence consistent with C is true at the root of some component. Here: The source action models are a set complete for C. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's request, 2026-09-27.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The three members' verbatim copies stated once.

### Fails □Transversal.

Every pure sentence consistent with C is possible at the root (pure-sentences-possible): the negation of the type-$e$ instance of Transversal is a pure sentence consistent with C, since it holds in symmetric-infinite-classes, so it is possible at the root.

*From the group *Coalesced sums at a new root*, shared argument `coalesced-sums#transversal-boxed`. It requires that The components are a family of action models complete for C: every sentence consistent with C is true at the root of some component. Here: The source action models are a set complete for C. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), 2026-09-28.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The three members' verbatim copies stated once; "By the same argument" became a reference to pure-sentences-possible.

### Holds Distinctness-preserving collapse.

For a true $p$, $a\le p$, since $a$ entails every truth. Take $q:=a$ in the definition of $\Box_{\ne}p$: at a world in $a$, $p$ holds; at a world outside $a$, $\Diamond a$ fails. So every truth is $\Box_{\ne}$-necessary.

*General argument `arguments/dpc-isolated-actual-world`. It requires that The actual-world proposition $a$ is in the domain and entails every truth, and no world outside $a$ sees a world in $a$. Here: The singleton root proposition, true at the root's identity arrow and nowhere in a component, is in the domain and entails every truth; the components have no arrows back to the root (Classicism, Appendix E, p. 83, on the distinctness-preserving collapse). By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-23.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The finite-support, symmetric and full action models' copies (eight records) stated once for the topic; what varied, why no world outside the actual world sees back into it, is each record's reason for meeting actual-world-isolated.

## History

The record's revision log before it was written as arguments.

- **2026-09-28** (Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic)) — Recorded the failure of □Transversal: every pure sentence consistent with C is possible at the root, and symmetric-infinite-classes refutes Transversal at type e. Now violates: □Transversal.

- **2026-09-25** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added Transversal Choice at the root, by the argument recorded for Relational Choice: a root entity has an arbitrary root component, so take the property whose root component is a transversal, chosen in the metatheory, of the root component of an equivalence relation at the root, with empty component parts; the equivalence and transversal conditions are all evaluated at the root's identity arrow. Recorded on a question of Zachary Goodsell, after an observation of Christopher Sun. Now satisfies: Transversal Choice.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Corrected the Boolean Completeness claim from the type-t instance to the type schema, since no component is known to refute it at type t; added the failure of Countable Boolean Completeness by the same transfer. Now violates: Boolean Completeness, Countable Boolean Completeness.
- **2026-09-23** (Cian Dorr, recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Restored the failure of Boolean Completeness (type t), now that a component refuting it at type t is on the map; see the notes. Now violates: Boolean Completeness (type t).

- **2026-09-22** (Cian Dorr, recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Settled Atomicity (type t), Boolean Completeness (type t) and Possibility+ (pure) as failing and the Axiom of Infinity (type e) and Relational Choice as holding, with the arguments in the notes; Cian Dorr’s observations, with Relational Choice corrected in direction. Now satisfies: Axiom of Infinity (type e), Relational Choice. Now violates: Atomicity (type t), Possibility+ (pure).
- **2026-09-22** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Recorded the failure of □Relational Choice, already argued in the notes. Now violates: □Relational Choice.
- **2026-09-17** (OpenAI Codex (GPT-6)) — Adopted the source’s relational type system at the user’s request. The cited construction now directly supplies the recorded model; the former type-extension obligation is removed. Now satisfies: Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ), Actuality, Distinctness-preserving collapse. Now violates: Strong Possibility (pure), ND.
