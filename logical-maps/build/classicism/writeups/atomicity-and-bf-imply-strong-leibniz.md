# Atomicity ∧ BF ⇒ Strong Leibniz Biconditionals

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Philosophical Introduction to HOL (2024), Lean `Classicism.Map.atomicity_and_bf_imply_strong_leibniz`; produced by Andrew Bacon; set as Exercise 8.12, solution written out by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 22 September 2026; recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 22 September 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **Atomicity.** Every non-bottom entity of each relational type has an atom below it.
- **BF.** The Barcan Formula at every type. The predicate formulation closes the formula schema using lambda abstraction.

## Conclusion

- **Strong Leibniz Biconditionals.** At each relational type, every possible entity (one distinct from bottom) is entailed by a strong world: a possible entity that necessarily entails every entity of the type or its negation. The right-to-left direction is a theorem of C; the principle records the substantive direction.

## Proof

Let $W$ be a weak world of relational type $\sigma$: $W\ne\bot$ and $\forall Y\, .\,W\le Y\lor W\le\neg Y$. We show $\Box\forall Y\, .\,W\le Y\lor W\le\neg Y$. Each instance is necessary once true, since $W\le Y$ is $\Box$ of a closed formula and 4 holds; so $\forall Y\, .\,\Box(W\le Y\lor W\le\neg Y)$. BF at type $\sigma$ (the instance for the property $\lambda Y\, .\,W\le Y\lor W\le\neg Y$) turns this into $\Box\forall Y\, .\,W\le Y\lor W\le\neg Y$. Thus every weak world is a strong world, and Atomicity supplies a weak world below each possible $X$.

## Notes

Bacon states this for relational types other than e, which is the map’s type range for both worlds principles; BF is used only at those types.
