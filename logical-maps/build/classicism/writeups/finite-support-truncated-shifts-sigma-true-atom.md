<p class='cert'>Model — Source: Classicism (2024); produced by Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr; recorded by OpenAI Codex (GPT-6), 17 September 2026.</p>

## Package

- **Rigid Power.** If a relation is rigid, so is the property of being a rigid relation that entails it.
- **Tame Rigidity.** Every weakly rigid relation, including a proposition, is rigid.
- **Axiom of Infinity (type e).** There are not finitely many individuals. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **Axiom of Infinity (type t).** There are not finitely many propositions. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **Actuality.** There is a true proposition that entails every true proposition.
- **Atomicity.** Every non-bottom entity of each relational type has an atom below it.
- **BF.** The Barcan Formula at every type. The predicate formulation closes the formula schema using lambda abstraction.
- **Distinctness-preserving collapse.** Every truth is necessary under the distinctness-preserving modality.
- **Infinity Schema (type e).** There are arbitrarily many pairwise distinct entities of this fixed type; one sentence for each positive integer n.
- **Infinity Schema (type t).** There are arbitrarily many pairwise distinct entities of this fixed type; one sentence for each positive integer n.
- **□Intensional Choice.** Every closed instance of Intensional Choice is necessary. Box the entire object-variable closure; retain the same type range and other schema side conditions.
- **No Pure Contingency.** Each closed sentence of the pure language, if true, is necessary. This is a sentence schema, not a quantifier over propositions.
- **Transversal Choice.** Every equivalence relation, at any type including e, has a transversal, that is, a property with exactly one instance in each of its cells.
- **¬ Boolean Completeness.** Every property of entities of a relational type has a greatest lower bound in that type.
- **¬ Countable Boolean Completeness.** Every countable property of entities of a relational type has a least upper bound in that type, where a property is countable when it injects into the natural numbers.
- **¬ Boolean Completeness (type t).** Boolean Completeness (type t) in the displayed closed propositional formulation.
- **¬ B for sentences of Σ.** The B instance for every closed sentence of the language of the fixed signature Sigma.
- **¬ No Contingency (signature Σ).** Each closed sentence of the language of the fixed signature Sigma, if true, is necessary. A sentence schema, standing to No Pure Contingency as Possibility Maximalism (signature Σ) stands to Possibility Maximalism (pure).
- **¬ Witnessed Possibility.** For pure-formulas P with free variables among a finite tuple x, and distinct matching nonlogical constants c, a witness to P entails that P at those constants is possible.
- **¬ Separated Structure.** For each typed nonlogical constant c and closed same-typed terms F,G not containing c, equality after application to c implies equality of F and G.
- **¬ Independence (signature Σ).** No constant of Sigma is a pure operation applied to other constants: for a closed pure term A and distinct constants c, d_1,…,d_n with n ≥ 0, c differs from A applied to the d’s. With n = 0, no constant denotes a pure entity.
- **¬ Maximalism (signature Σ).** The Maximalism schema for the fixed nonlogical signature Σ: every closed identity of its language not provable in C(Σ) is false.

## Definition

Proposition D.5, part 8 (pp. 78–79): the arrows are the maps $k_n$ with $k_nm=0$ for $m\le n$ and $k_nm=m-n$ otherwise, which compose as $k_n\circ k_m=k_{n+m}$; $k_0$ is the identity. In every part, $W_0^\ddagger$ is the set of finite subsets of $\mathbb N$ and the model is ideally full: a proposition is a set of arrows whose membership depends only on the arrows’ values on some finite set of numbers (it is pinned down by that set), and an entity of a higher type is an applicative behaviour profile pinned down by a finite set in the same sense. The individuals are the natural numbers, acted on by the arrows themselves. Propositions and properties are thus about finitely many numbers and indifferent to how the arrows treat the rest. Evaluation point: the sole object, at the identity arrow.

Interpretation of Σ, fixed for this record: one designated relational constant $c$ of type $\tau=\bar\sigma t$ denotes $\lambda\bar x\, .\,a$, where $a$ is the unique true atom of the model, the actual-world proposition, whose only member is the identity arrow; every other constant of Σ, of which there is at least one, is relational and denotes the top element of its type.

## Arguments

### Holds Rigid Power.

Write $X_0(E)$ for the intension $n\mapsto k_n\cdot E$. Every arrow is finitely determined, so, as in the group's argument for Tame Rigidity, a weakly inextensible relation is $X_0$ of its extension at the identity, and the rigid relations are the $X_0(E)$ that are in the domain, namely those with $k_n\cdot E$ constant for all $n$ beyond some $s$. For rigid $F=X_0(S)$ the power property $\lambda X\, .\,\operatorname{Rigid}(X)\land X\le F$ has extension $\{X_0(T'):T'\subseteq k_m\cdot S,\ X_0(T')\text{ in the domain}\}$ at $k_m$, while its extension at the identity transported along $k_m$ is $\{X_0(k_m\cdot T):T\subseteq S,\ X_0(T)\text{ in the domain}\}$. Given such a $T'$, put $T:=\{q\in S: k_m\cdot q\in T'\}$, so that $k_m\cdot T=T'$. Since $k_{n-m}\circ k_m=k_n$ for $n\ge m$, transport gives $k_n\cdot T=k_{n-m}\cdot T'$ for $n\ge m$, constant for large $n$; so $X_0(T)$ is in the domain. Hence the power property is $X_0$ of its extension; and $k_n$ applied to that extension is, by the same correspondence, $\{X_0(T''):T''\subseteq k_n\cdot S,\ X_0(T'')\text{ in the domain}\}$, constant for $n>s$, so the power property is in the domain and rigid. The boxed form follows from No Pure Contingency.

### Holds Tame Rigidity.

Write a relation $Y$ as its intension $k\mapsto Y_k$. Then $Y\bar a$ holds at $k$ iff $k\cdot\bar a\in Y_k$, $(h\cdot Y)_k=Y_{k\circ h}$, and $\le$ is inclusion of intensions. Put $X_0(S)_k:=k\cdot S$. (1) In any one-object model, if $Y_k=k\cdot Y_1$ for every $k$ then $Y$ is rigid: persistence is immediate, and for the boxed weak inextensibility, $(h\cdot Y)_k=k\cdot(h\cdot Y_1)=X_0(Y_h)_k$, which lies inside every $X$ that contains $X_0(Y_h)$. (2) Let $Y$ be weakly rigid with extension $S$. For each finite $N^{\prime}$ the intension $B_{N^{\prime}}(S)_k:=\bigcup_{k^{\prime}\equiv_{N^{\prime}}k}k^{\prime}\cdot S$ is pinned down by $N^{\prime}$, so it is in the domain. It contains $X_0(S)$, so weak inextensibility gives $Y\subseteq B_{N^{\prime}}(S)$, and persistence gives $Y\supseteq X_0(S)$; hence $k\cdot S\subseteq Y_k\subseteq\bigcap_{N^{\prime}}\bigcup_{k^{\prime}\equiv_{N^{\prime}}k}k^{\prime}\cdot S$. By the condition, for $k$ other than the identity some finite $N^{\prime}$ has $k$ as the only arrow agreeing with it there, and the bounds meet: $Y_k=k\cdot S$. So every weakly rigid relation at every type is rigid by (1), and Tame Rigidity holds. With No Pure Contingency, which holds in a one-object model, the map's results give $\Box$Tame Rigidity.

*From the group *Finite-support action models on one object*, shared argument `finite-support-one-object#tame-rigidity`. It requires that Every arrow other than the identity is finitely determined: its singleton is a proposition pinned down by a finite set. Here: For $n\ge1$, $k_n(n+1)=1$ singles out $k_n$, and $k_0(1)=1$ singles out $k_0$; each singleton is pinned down by that one point. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), 2026-10-02.*

*Revised 2026-10-03 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Recorded from the argument deferred in extraction.md on 2 October until the model records' new format landed (not yet checked by a human). Lemma 2's remark that $B_{N^{\prime}}(S)$ is symmetric whenever the model is, which these models do not need, is left out.

### Holds Axiom of Infinity (type e).

The individuals are the natural numbers and identity at the evaluation arrow is literal, so no numeral counts them. The set of numerals at type $e$ is invariant under every arrow, hence has empty support and lies in the domain, so finite cardinality is standard and no finite cardinality holds of the universal property.

*From the group *Finite-support action models on one object*, shared argument `finite-support-one-object#axiom-of-infinity`. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-09-20.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Split from the argument for both types; the type-$t$ half, which does not need infinitely many individuals, is axiom-of-infinity-t.

### Holds Axiom of Infinity (type t).

The propositions that a given number is fixed by the arrow, one for each number, are pairwise distinct and each has that number as finite support, so there are infinitely many propositions. The set of numerals at type $t$ is invariant under every arrow, hence has empty support and lies in the domain, so finite cardinality is standard and no finite cardinality holds of the universal property.

*From the group *Finite-support action models on one object*, shared argument `finite-support-one-object#axiom-of-infinity-t`. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-09-20.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The type-$t$ half of the old argument, "individual" becoming "number", so that it covers the one-individual variants.

### Holds Actuality.

The actual-world proposition, whose only member is the identity, is then in the domain. It is true, and it entails every truth, since every true proposition contains the identity.

*Source: Classicism, Proposition D.5, parts 4, 5, 7 and 8, pp. 78–79. From the group *Finite-support action models on one object*, shared argument `finite-support-one-object#actual-world`. It requires that The singleton of the identity arrow is pinned down by a finite set. Here: $\{k_0\}$ is pinned down by $\{1\}$, since $k_n1=0$ for $n>0$. By Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr, 2026-09-17.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Stated once for the group; each member's pinning set moved to the condition actual-world-pinned.

### Holds Atomicity.

That singleton is an atom below the proposition.

*Source: Classicism, Proposition D.5, parts 6–8, pp. 78–79. From the group *Finite-support action models on one object*, shared argument `finite-support-one-object#atomicity`. It requires that Every nonempty proposition contains an arrow whose singleton is pinned down by a finite set. Here: $\{k_0\}$ and each $\{k_n\}$ are pinned down by finite sets: $k_n$ is the only arrow sending $n+1$ to $1$. By Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr, 2026-09-17.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Stated once for the group; each member's pinning sets moved to the condition pinned-atoms.

### Fails Boolean Completeness.

At type $e\to t$. In the source's terms an upper bound of the haecceities of the members of $A$ is a persistent property whose extension contains $A$. A least one, pinned down by $\{0,\ldots,n\}$, would be the strongest such property pinned down by $\{0,\ldots,n\}$, and would also lie below the strongest pinned down by $\{0,\ldots,m\}$ for each $m>n$, which by the condition is strictly stronger. So the haecceities have no least upper bound.

*Source: Classicism, Proposition D.5, parts 1–8, pp. 75–79. From the group *Finite-support action models on one object*, shared argument `finite-support-one-object#boolean-completeness`. It requires that For some set $A$ of individuals, the strongest persistent property whose extension contains $A$ and which is pinned down by $\{0,\ldots,n\}$ becomes strictly stronger as $n$ grows. Here: With $A$ the even numbers: the strongest persistent property pinned down by $\{0,\ldots,n\}$ whose extension contains them has, at $k_m$, the evens, the odds with $0$, or all of $\mathbb N$ according as $m<n$ is even, $m<n$ is odd, or $m\ge n$. By Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr, 2026-09-17.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Stated once for the group, with the step from "ever stronger" to the missing least upper bound spelled out; each member's strongest persistent properties moved to the condition unbounded-haecceities.

### Fails Countable Boolean Completeness.

At type $e\to t$: the property $E$ whose extension is the family of haecceities of the members of $A$, which has no least upper bound by the shared argument boolean-completeness, is countable, and the extensional fullness the source invokes to put $E$ in the domain also puts in the relation pairing the haecceity of the $k$-th member of $A$ with the numeral $k$, which injects $E$ into the numerals.

*From the group *Finite-support action models on one object*, shared argument `finite-support-one-object#countable-boolean-completeness`. It requires that For some set $A$ of individuals, the strongest persistent property whose extension contains $A$ and which is pinned down by $\{0,\ldots,n\}$ becomes strictly stronger as $n$ grows. Here: With $A$ the even numbers: the strongest persistent property pinned down by $\{0,\ldots,n\}$ whose extension contains them has, at $k_m$, the evens, the odds with $0$, or all of $\mathbb N$ according as $m<n$ is even, $m<n$ is odd, or $m\ge n$. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-23.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Now builds on the shared argument boolean-completeness instead of on each member's source argument; no change of substance.

### Fails Boolean Completeness (type t).

The source (n. 92) conjectures this but does not show it. Any set $F$ of propositions is the extension at the identity of an element of the domain at type $t\to t$, namely the profile $\langle h,p\rangle\mapsto\{i : i\cdot p\in F\}$: it is natural, independent of $h$ and so pinned down by the empty set, and each of its values is pinned down by the pinning set of $p$, since $i\cdot p$ depends only on the values of $i$ there. A least upper bound of $F$ under entailment is a least finitely pinned superset of $\bigcup F$, and it exists only if the least $S$-pinned superset of $\bigcup F$ stops shrinking as the finite set $S$ grows. So the family $F$ of the condition has no least upper bound, and, taking pointwise negations, the family of complements has no greatest lower bound.

*From the group *Finite-support action models on one object*, shared argument `finite-support-one-object#boolean-completeness-t`. It requires that Some family $F$ of propositions has no least finitely pinned superset of its union $\bigcup F$. Here: An arrow $k_n$ is determined by its value at any $m\ge n$ and all $k_n$ with $n\ge N$ agree on $\{0,\ldots,N\}$, so the finitely pinned propositions are exactly the finite and cofinite sets of arrows. Let $F$ be the family of singletons $\{k_{2j}\}$: a finitely pinned superset of $\bigcup F$ is a cofinite set, and removing from it an odd-indexed member gives a strictly smaller one. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-25.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The seven members' copies stated once, each member's family moved to the condition no-least-pinned-cover; the truncations' separate argument of 23 September, by Claude Fable 5.1 prompted by Cian Dorr, is now its witness, its own proof that the family is in the domain giving way to the profile above. The trawl's second arguments for the same verdict (25 September, DeepSeek, reviewed by OpenAI Codex) were dropped.

### Holds BF.

By Proposition D.6.

*Source: Classicism, Proposition D.6, p. 76. General argument `arguments/barcan-d6`. It requires that The model is an ideally full action model in which every arrow out of the evaluation object acts surjectively both on the individuals and on the pinning sets (Proposition D.6's hypothesis). Here: $k_n$ sends $0$ to $0$ and $m+n$ to $m$ for $m\ge1$, so it is a surjection of $\mathbb N$. So each arrow acts surjectively on the pinning sets, the finite subsets of $\mathbb N$, and on the individuals, whether these are the natural numbers or a single one that every arrow fixes. By Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr, 2026-09-17.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The finite-support members' citations of Proposition D.6 stated once, then moved to the topic; each model's reason for meeting D.6's hypothesis is under its `meets`.

### Holds Distinctness-preserving collapse.

For a true $p$, $a\le p$, since $a$ entails every truth. Take $q:=a$ in the definition of $\Box_{\ne}p$: at a world in $a$, $p$ holds; at a world outside $a$, $\Diamond a$ fails. So every truth is $\Box_{\ne}$-necessary.

*General argument `arguments/dpc-isolated-actual-world`. It requires that The actual-world proposition $a$ is in the domain and entails every truth, and no world outside $a$ sees a world in $a$. Here: The actual-world proposition, whose only member is the identity, is pinned down by a finite set, so it is in the domain and entails every truth; every other arrow is non-injective, so no composite with it is the identity. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-23.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The finite-support, symmetric and full action models' copies (eight records) stated once for the topic; what varied, why no world outside the actual world sees back into it, is each record's reason for meeting actual-world-isolated.

### Holds Axiom of Infinity (type e), Infinity Schema (type e).

The Infinity schema holds, there being $n$ distinct individuals for every $n$. For the Axiom: by extensional fullness the domain has a property of cardinalities true of $Z$ exactly when every property $Z$ holds of has a finite extension. It holds of $\mathbf{0}_e$, which holds only of empty properties, and passes from $Y$ to $\operatorname{Suc}_e Y$, which holds of $F$ only if $Y$ holds of $F$ less one of its instances. So every finite cardinality has it, and none holds of the universal property, whose extension is infinite.

*General argument `arguments/infinitely-many-individuals`. It requires that The model is extensionally full at every object: every set of tuples from the domains at an object is the extension, at the identity arrow, of an element of the domain of the matching relational type there. Here: The model is ideally full, hence extensionally full at every object (Appendix D, the remark after Definition D.3): for any set $R$ of tuples from the domains at an object $V$, the intension that assigns to every arrow out of $V$ into an object $U$ a fixed set $R_U$ of tuples from $U$’s domains, with $R_V=R$, is pinned down by $\emptyset$, so it is the intension of an element of $V^{\bar\sigma\to t}$ with extension $R$ at $1_V$. It requires that There are infinitely many individuals at the evaluation world. Here: The individuals are the natural numbers. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Holds Axiom of Infinity (type t), Infinity Schema (type t).

As for individuals (the argument infinitely-many-individuals), at type $t$: the Infinity schema holds, and by extensional fullness the property of cardinalities that hold only of properties with finite extensions is in the domain, has every finite cardinality, and excludes those holding of the universal property of propositions, whose extension is infinite.

*General argument `arguments/infinitely-many-propositions`. It requires that The model is extensionally full at every object: every set of tuples from the domains at an object is the extension, at the identity arrow, of an element of the domain of the matching relational type there. Here: The model is ideally full, hence extensionally full at every object (Appendix D, the remark after Definition D.3): for any set $R$ of tuples from the domains at an object $V$, the intension that assigns to every arrow out of $V$ into an object $U$ a fixed set $R_U$ of tuples from $U$’s domains, with $R_V=R$, is pinned down by $\emptyset$, so it is the intension of an element of $V^{\bar\sigma\to t}$ with extension $R$ at $1_V$. It requires that There are infinitely many propositions at the evaluation world. Here: The propositions that a given number is fixed by the arrow, one for each number, are pairwise distinct, each pinned down by that number (the shared argument axiom-of-infinity-t). By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Holds □Intensional Choice.

For each object $U$ and type $\sigma$ fix a well-ordering $<_U$ of the domain $D^\sigma_U$, and let $W$ be the intension of type $\sigma\to\sigma\to t$ with $W(h):={<_{\operatorname{cod}h}}$. Its value depends only on the arrow's codomain, so by the condition it is in the domain, and at every world its extension well-orders that world's type-$\sigma$ domain. Given $F$ with $\Box\exists x\, .\,Fx$, put $G:=\lambda x\, .\,Fx\land\forall y\, .\,(Fy\to\neg Wyx)$, the $W$-least $F$. It is definable from $F$ and $W$, so in the domain; $G\le F$, and its extension at every arrow is the singleton of the least element of $F$'s. So Intensional Choice holds, and the same at every reachable object gives $\Box$Intensional Choice. Cian Dorr's observation that such models are qualitatively full, made precise.

*General argument `arguments/intensional-choice-well-ordering`. It requires that At every object reachable from the evaluation point, the domain contains every intension whose value at an arrow depends only on the arrow's codomain. Here: With one object such an intension is constant, so it is pinned down by $\emptyset$, and the domain holds every finitely pinned intension. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's suggestion, 2026-10-03.*

### Holds No Pure Contingency.

Closed pure terms denote entities fixed by every arrow (§3.5, p. 58). With a single object, a proposition fixed by every arrow contains every arrow if it contains the identity and no arrow otherwise, so a true closed pure sentence is necessary: the source's one-object No Pure Contingency observation (p. 79), applied to each closed instance.

*Source: Classicism, §3.5, p. 58; p. 79. General argument `arguments/no-pure-contingency-one-object`. It requires that The model is an action model (Classicism, Appendix D), or an intensional action model in the sense of Dorr's draft (Boolean Completeness does not imply Rigid Comprehension), with a single object. Here: Each part of Proposition D.5 is a one-object category acting on $\mathbb N$ (Appendix D, Definitions D.1–D.3). By Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr, 2026-09-17.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Moved from the group finite-support-one-object to the topic, for every one-object action model; the reason the source's observation holds is spelled out in place of "Boxed positive flags use the source’s explicit one-object No Pure Contingency observation, applied separately to each closed instance."

### Fails B for sentences of Σ.

B for sentences of Σ fails: the Σ-sentence $\forall\bar x\, .\,c\bar x$ denotes $a$, which is true, and under an arrow from which no world in $a$ is accessible $\Diamond a$ is false, so $\Box\Diamond a$ fails.

*General argument `arguments/sigma-true-atom-b`. It requires that Σ has a designated relational constant $c$ of type $\tau=\bar\sigma t$ denoting $\lambda\bar x\, .\,a$, where $a$ is the actual-world proposition, the unique true atom; every other constant, of which there is at least one, is relational and denotes the top element of its type. Here: This is the interpretation. It requires that The actual-world proposition $a$, the strongest truth, is in the domain; it is necessary at no world, and some arrow does not fix it. Here: The actual-world proposition is in the domain, being pinned down by a finite set; at every arrow some composite is not the identity, since every other arrow is non-injective, so it is necessary at no arrow, and a non-identity arrow carries it to the empty set. It requires that Some world sees no world at which the actual-world proposition is true. Here: A non-identity arrow is non-injective, so no arrow composes it back to the identity. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr’s request, 2026-09-22.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The B clause of the records' Σ-as-true-atom argument, stated once for the topic.

### Fails No Contingency (signature Σ), Witnessed Possibility, Separated Structure, Independence (signature Σ), Maximalism (signature Σ).

No Contingency (signature Σ) fails, since the Σ-sentence $\forall\bar x\, .\,c\bar x$ denotes $a$, true and contingent; Witnessed Possibility fails for the pure formula $x=\top_\tau$, witnessed by $\top_\tau$, since $\Diamond(c=\top_\tau)$ is $\Diamond\Box a$ and $a$ is necessary at no world; Separated Structure fails with it, being equivalent to Possibly Witnessed Possibility; Independence (signature Σ) and Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ) fail through the other relational constants: such a constant $c'$ of type $\tau'$ denotes what the closed pure term $\top_{\tau'}$ denotes, and $c'=\top_{\tau'}$ is a true identity that C(Σ) does not prove. The designated constant refutes neither: closed pure terms denote entities fixed by every arrow (Classicism, §3.5, p. 58), whereas some arrow does not fix $a$, so no closed pure term denotes $\lambda\bar x\, .\,a$.

*General argument `arguments/sigma-true-atom`. It requires that Σ has a designated relational constant $c$ of type $\tau=\bar\sigma t$ denoting $\lambda\bar x\, .\,a$, where $a$ is the actual-world proposition, the unique true atom; every other constant, of which there is at least one, is relational and denotes the top element of its type. Here: This is the interpretation. It requires that The actual-world proposition $a$, the strongest truth, is in the domain; it is necessary at no world, and some arrow does not fix it. Here: The actual-world proposition is in the domain, being pinned down by a finite set; at every arrow some composite is not the identity, since every other arrow is non-injective, so it is necessary at no arrow, and a non-identity arrow carries it to the empty set. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr’s request, 2026-09-22.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The verbatim copies in ten records (finite-support, symmetric and full action models) stated once for the topic. Its B clause is now sigma-true-atom-b, which needs an arrow from which the actual world is out of reach. "$a$ is fixed by no arrow but the identity" became "some arrow does not fix $a$": in a symmetric model the actual-world proposition is the symmetry group, which its members fix, and the conclusion needs only the weaker claim.

### Holds Transversal Choice.

For an equivalence relation at the evaluation point, a transversal of its extension there, chosen in the metatheory, is by extensional fullness the extension of an element of the domain; the equivalence and transversal conditions are unboxed.

*General argument `arguments/transversal-choice-extensionally-full`. It requires that The model is extensionally full at every object: every set of tuples from the domains at an object is the extension, at the identity arrow, of an element of the domain of the matching relational type there. Here: The model is ideally full, hence extensionally full at every object (Appendix D, the remark after Definition D.3): for any set $R$ of tuples from the domains at an object $V$, the intension that assigns to every arrow out of $V$ into an object $U$ a fixed set $R_U$ of tuples from $U$’s domains, with $R_V=R$, is pinned down by $\emptyset$, so it is the intension of an element of $V^{\bar\sigma\to t}$ with extension $R$ at $1_V$. By Cian Dorr (observation); recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), on a question of Zachary Goodsell, after an observation of Christopher Sun, 2026-09-25.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The Relational Choice and Transversal Choice arguments merged into one, stated for every extensionally full model.

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Moved from the group finite-support-one-object to the topic. Its first sentence, deriving extensional fullness from ideal fullness, is now the group's reason for meeting extensionally-full.

- **2026-09-25** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added Transversal Choice, by the argument recorded for Relational Choice: the model is extensionally full at every object, so for an equivalence relation at the evaluation point a transversal of its extension there, chosen in the metatheory, is the extension of an element pinned down by the empty set; the equivalence and transversal conditions are unboxed. Recorded on a question of Zachary Goodsell, after an observation of Christopher Sun. Now satisfies: Transversal Choice.
- **2026-09-25** (OpenAI Codex (GPT-6)) — Accepted the trawl's type-t Boolean Completeness failure after checking the finite/cofinite domain and replacing the conditional higher-type argument by the source's extensional-fullness lemma. Informal review; no Lean verification. Now violates: Boolean Completeness (type t).
- **2026-09-25** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added the failure of Boolean Completeness (type t); see the notes. Now violates: Boolean Completeness (type t).
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Expanded the description from Appendix D, naming Proposition D.5 and its part; added the failure of Countable Boolean Completeness at type e→t; settled the Distinctness-preserving collapse. Now satisfies: Distinctness-preserving collapse. Now violates: Countable Boolean Completeness.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Re-fixed the interpretation of Σ so as to settle No Contingency (signature Σ) and B for sentences of Σ, at Cian Dorr’s request; see the notes. Now violates: No Contingency (signature Σ), B for sentences of Σ.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Corrected the reason given for the failures of Independence (signature Σ) and Distinctness (signature Σ): the true atom is denoted by no closed pure term, since such terms denote entities fixed by every arrow; the failures come from the other relational constants, which denote top. No verdict changes.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added Relational Choice and its necessitation at Cian Dorr’s direction: ideally full models are extensionally full at every object, and choice in the metatheory supplies the functional subrelation; see the notes. Now satisfies: Relational Choice, □Relational Choice.
- **2026-09-22** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Fixed an interpretation of Σ (relational constants as top, individual constants as one fixed individual) and recorded the signature schemata it refutes, at Cian Dorr’s request. Now violates: Witnessed Possibility, Separated Structure, Independence (signature Σ), Maximalism (signature Σ).
- **2026-09-20** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added both Axioms of Infinity at Cian Dorr's direction. The individuals are the natural numbers and identity at the evaluation arrow is literal, so no numeral counts them. The propositions that a given individual is fixed by the arrow, one for each individual, are pairwise distinct and each has that individual as finite support, so there are infinitely many propositions. The set of numerals at each type is invariant under every arrow, hence has empty support and lies in the domain, so finite cardinality is standard and no finite cardinality holds of the universal property at either type. Now satisfies: Axiom of Infinity (type e), Axiom of Infinity (type t).
- **2026-09-17** (OpenAI Codex (GPT-6)) — Adopted the source’s relational type system at the user’s request. The cited construction now directly supplies the recorded model; the former type-extension obligation is removed. Now satisfies: Atomicity, Actuality, BF, No Pure Contingency, □Atomicity, □Actuality, □BF. Now violates: ND, Boolean Completeness, Rigid Comprehension.
