# Extensionality ⇒ Atomicity

## Premises

- **Extensionality.** At each relational type, coextensive relations are identical; include the nullary propositional case.

## Conclusion

- **Atomicity.** Every non-bottom entity of each relational type has an atom below it.

## Proof

At type t, the Fregean Axiom leaves just $\bot,\top$ and $\top$ is an atom. At a relation type, each tuple’s haecceity $\lambda\bar z\, .\,\bigwedge_i z_i=y_i$ is an atom by Extensionality. A non-bottom relation has an instance, whose tuple-haecceity is below that relation.
