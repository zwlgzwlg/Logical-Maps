# □Strong Leibniz Biconditionals ∧ Rigid Comprehension ⇒ □BF (type t)

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Philosophical Introduction to HOL (2024); produced by Andrew Bacon; recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 22 September 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **□Strong Leibniz Biconditionals.** Necessarily, at each relational type, every possible entity (one distinct from bottom) is entailed by a strong world: a possible entity that necessarily entails every entity of the type or its negation.
- **Rigid Comprehension.** Every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a rigid one.

## Conclusion

- **□BF (type t).** Necessarily, BF (type t) holds, in the displayed closed propositional formulation.

## Proof

Theorem 8.2 of the book: given Rigid Comprehension, $\Box\mathrm{SL}_\sigma$ at all relational types implies $\Box\mathrm{BF}_\sigma$ for every relational $\sigma\ne e$. Its proof for $\sigma=t$ (pp. 170–171): from $\Diamond\exists p\, .\,Xp$, $X$ is a possible property, so by $\mathrm{SL}_{tt}$ it is entailed by a strong world property $W$; let $H$ be the rigid collection, supplied by Rigid Comprehension, of world properties accessible to $W$, and let $r:=\exists V\, .\,\exists p\, .\,HV\land Vp\land p$. Bacon shows $\Box\forall p\, .\,Wp\to p=r$, using $\Box\mathrm{SL}_t$ for the step that every world proposition entails $\exists V\, .\,HV\land Vp$ and the rigidity of $H$ for the converse; since $W$ entails $X$, $\Diamond Xr$, which gives $\exists p\, .\,\Diamond Xp$, the contrapositive of $\mathrm{BF}_t$. The argument is carried out under necessary assumptions, so it yields $\Box\mathrm{BF}_t$. The map records the type-$t$ instance; the book proves the same for every relational type other than $e$.

## Notes

The map has no node for BF restricted to relational types, so the conclusion is recorded at type t, the case the book proves in full. The right-to-left half of Theorem 8.2 is the recorded implication from □Atomicity and □BF to □SL, which needs no Rigid Comprehension.
