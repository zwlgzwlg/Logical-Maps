# Weakly Rigid Power ⇒ Rigid Power

## Premises

- **Weakly Rigid Power.** If a relation is weakly rigid, so is the property of being a weakly rigid relation that entails it.

## Conclusion

- **Rigid Power.** If a relation is rigid, so is the property of being a rigid relation that entails it.

## Proof

Fix the type tuple, and for $F$ of type $\bar\sigma t$ write $P_F:=\lambda X\, .\,\operatorname{WeaklyRigid}(X)\land X\le F$ and $R_F:=\lambda X\, .\,\operatorname{Rigid}(X)\land X\le F$. Suppose $\operatorname{Rigid}(F)$. By T, $F$ is weakly rigid, so Weakly Rigid Power makes $P_F$ weakly rigid. Weakly Rigid Power implies Tame Rigidity (recorded) at every type, in particular at $(\bar\sigma t)t$, so $P_F$ is rigid. Its persistence is $\Box\forall X\, .\,P_FX\to\Box P_FX$, and $\Box P_FX$ gives $\Box\operatorname{WeaklyRigid}(X)$, that is $\operatorname{Rigid}(X)$, and $\Box(X\le F)$; so $P_F\le R_F$. Conversely $R_F\le P_F$, since rigidity implies weak rigidity by T, at every world. Mutual entailment is identity in C, so $R_F=P_F$, and $R_F$ is rigid. Tame Rigidity at the evaluation point alone does not identify the two properties, since they can differ at other worlds; the identity comes from the boxed persistence of $P_F$.
