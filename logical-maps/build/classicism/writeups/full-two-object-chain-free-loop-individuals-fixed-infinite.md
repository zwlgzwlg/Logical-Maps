<p class='cert'>Model — Source: Misc.; produced by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Zachary Goodsell, 19 October 2026; recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Zachary Goodsell, 19 October 2026.</p>

## Package

- **Possible Infinity (type t).** Possibly there are not finitely many propositions: the Axiom of Infinity at this type, under a diamond.
- **Arithmetic Necessitism.** Given that necessarily zero is not a successor and successor is injective on numbers, the numbers at $\sigma$ form a rigid property with necessarily distinct instances. One sentence for each type $\sigma$.
- **Truths are ND-necessary.** Every truth is ND-necessary, that is, necessary under the distinctness-preserving modality.
- **□Truths are 5-necessary.** Necessarily, every truth is 5-necessary: necessary under every S5 operator. In C this is the identity $\Box_5=\lambda p\, .\,p$.
- **□Atomicity.** Necessarily, every non-bottom entity of each relational type has an atom below it.
- **□Self-atoms are atoms.** Necessarily, at each relational type, every self-atom is an atom.
- **□Rigid Comprehension.** Necessarily, every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a rigid one.
- **□Self-atoms are strong atoms.** Necessarily, at each relational type, every self-atom is a strong atom: it necessarily entails every entity of the type or its negation.
- **Axiom of Infinity (type e).** There are not finitely many individuals. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **Infinity Schema (type e).** There are arbitrarily many pairwise distinct entities of this fixed type; one sentence for each positive integer n.
- **□Intensional Choice.** Necessarily, if a property is necessarily instantiated, then some property entailing it is necessarily uniquely instantiated.
- **□Relational Choice.** Necessarily, every serial binary relation has a functional subrelation.
- **□Transversal Choice.** Necessarily, every equivalence relation, at any type including e, has a transversal, that is, a property with exactly one instance in each of its cells.
- **Relational Choice.** Every serial binary relation has a functional subrelation.
- **Rigid Power.** If a relation is rigid, so is the property of being a rigid relation that entails it.
- **□Rigid Power.** Necessarily, if a relation is rigid, so is the property of being a rigid relation that entails it.
- **Necessity of Second-Order Analysis.** Every second-order analytical sentence is either true in every real number structure in every possible world or false in every real number structure in every possible world. One sentence for each type $\sigma$ and each second-order analytical sentence.
- **Transversal Choice.** Every equivalence relation, at any type including e, has a transversal, that is, a property with exactly one instance in each of its cells.
- **□Two-hat necessities are ND-necessary.** Necessarily, whatever is two-hat necessary is ND-necessary: the distinctness-preserving modality agrees with its hat. In C this is the identity $\hat{\hat\Box}=\Box_{\ne}$.
- **¬ B for pure sentences.** The B instance for every closed sentence in the pure language.
- **¬ Analytic Necessitism.** If there could be a real number structure, there is a rigid one that is necessarily a real number structure: a rigid property with necessarily distinct instances, with rigid order, addition, multiplication and natural numbers, which necessarily form a complete ordered field. One sentence for each type $\sigma$.
- **¬ Infinity Schema (type t).** There are arbitrarily many pairwise distinct entities of this fixed type; one sentence for each positive integer n.
- **¬ Axiom of Infinity (type t).** There are not finitely many propositions. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **¬ Self-Atomicity (type t).** Every possible proposition is entailed by a self-atom: a possible proposition that necessarily, if true, is an atom, that is, one that entails that it is the actual world.
- **¬ Atoms are self-atoms (type t).** Every atom is a self-atom: necessarily, if it is true, it is an atom.
- **¬ Strong Atomicity (type t).** Every possible proposition is entailed by a strong atom, one that is possible and necessarily entails every proposition or its negation.
- **¬ Fregean Axiom.** Materially equivalent propositions are identical.
- **¬ Witnessed Possibility.** For pure-formulas P with free variables among a finite tuple x, and distinct matching nonlogical constants c, a witness to P entails that P at those constants is possible.
- **¬ Separated Structure.** For each typed nonlogical constant c and closed same-typed terms F,G not containing c, equality after application to c implies equality of F and G.
- **¬ Independence (signature Σ).** No constant of Sigma is a pure operation applied to other constants: for a closed pure term A and distinct constants c, d_1,…,d_n with n ≥ 0, c differs from A applied to the d’s. With n = 0, no constant denotes a pure entity.
- **¬ Maximalism (signature Σ).** The Maximalism schema for the fixed nonlogical signature Σ: every closed identity of its language not provable in C(Σ) is false.
- **¬ ND (type t).** Distinct propositions are necessarily distinct.

## Definition

Use two objects $W_0$ and $W_1$. The arrows are the identities, one arrow $h\colon W_0\to W_1$, and the powers $s^n$ ($n\ge0$) of one endomorphism $s$ of $W_1$, which compose as $s^m\circ s^n=s^{m+n}$ and $s^n\circ h=h$, $h$ being the only arrow from $W_0$ to $W_1$; there is no arrow from $W_1$ to $W_0$. Evaluate at $W_0$.

Individuals, fixed for this record: at every object the individuals are the members of an infinite set $D$, the same at every object, and every arrow acts on them as the identity.

Interpretation of Σ, fixed for this record: every constant of Σ is relational, and each denotes the top element of its type.

Metatheory, fixed for this record: the axiom of choice is used freely, as in ordinary mathematics in ZFC, or in Lean's classical type theory for the verdicts certified there.

## Arguments

### Holds Possible Infinity (type t).

$W_1$ sees itself through infinitely many arrows, so, the model being full, it has infinitely many propositions, and at $W_1$ the Axiom of Infinity at type $t$ holds: the finite cardinalities of propositions there are the numerals, the inductive property of being a numeral being in the full domain, and the $k$-th numeral says that there are exactly $k$ propositions, which is false for every $k$. The arrow $h$ out of $W_0$ reaches $W_1$, so at $W_0$ the Axiom of Infinity at type $t$ is possible, although it fails there, $W_0$ having four propositions.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Zachary Goodsell, 19 October 2026.*

### Fails B for pure sentences.

The closed pure sentence that there are exactly four propositions is true at $W_0$ and false at $W_1$, which sees only itself; so it is not necessarily possible, and B fails for it.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Zachary Goodsell, 19 October 2026.*

### Fails Analytic Necessitism.

*Withdrawn 2026-10-29 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), prompted by Cian Dorr, after a trawl subagent's report: It rests on the step of the withdrawn analytic-necessitism-unretracted-arrow: the instances of a rigid carrier need not be determined by their transports along $h$, only to be transported injectively, and here they can be (see the argument analytic-necessitism-codomain-chain).*

At $W_0$, at type $tt$. The propositions at $W_1$ are the sets of the arrows $s^n$, continuum many, and an entity of type $tt$ at $W_0$ assigns any set of them to $h$ and any set of the four propositions at $W_0$ to the identity; so the entities of type $tt$ at $W_0$ include a copy of the reals and, the model being full, there is a real number structure of type $tt$ at $W_0$, complete since every subset of its carrier is the extension of a subproperty. A rigid one, necessarily a real number structure, is impossible: $h$ has no retraction, so, as in the general argument analytic-necessitism-unretracted-arrow, no entity of type $tt$ at $W_0$ is determined by its transport along $h$, its value at the identity being free, while the instances of a rigid carrier would have to be. With infinitely many individuals the general argument applies as it stands; this one covers the single individual, where the infinite type lies at $W_1$.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Zachary Goodsell, 2026-10-23.*

### Holds Analytic Necessitism, Second-Order Analytic Necessitism.

*Withdrawn 2026-10-30 by GPT-6 Astra, prompted by Daniel Kodsi: Its type-tt construction does not establish the schema at type t. The root has four propositions and sees continuum many, so possible Real_t holds and actual Real_t fails. See the new type-t argument and [proof](../writeups/analytic-necessitism-carrier-correction.md), section 3. The original text and the earlier withdrawal remain unchanged.*

At type $tt$. For a set $A$ of natural numbers let $Y_A$ be the intension whose value at every arrow into $W_1$ is $E^A$, for an injection $A\mapsto E^A$ into the sets of propositions at $W_1$, which are continuum many, and at the identity of $W_0$ is $\varnothing$. It depends only on the codomain, so it is in the full domain; its transport along $h$, or along any arrow into $W_1$, is the codomain-only intension at $W_1$ with value $E^A$; and distinct $A$ give distinct $Y_A$ at both objects. Carry the reals onto the $Y_A$ by codomain-only relations, whose values at $W_1$ are the transported sets of tuples. Along every arrow the structure goes to an isomorphic one, a real number structure at the target, the model being full. So it is rigid, with necessarily distinct instances, and necessarily a real number structure, and the codomain-only intensions of the sets of its codomain-only relations are represented powers. So Analytic Necessitism and its second-order form hold.

*Revised 2026-10-30 by GPT-6 Astra, prompted by Daniel Kodsi:* Withdrew only the asserted all-carrier AN/SOAN verdicts. The selected tt carrier is compatible with the counterexample; the older tt negative is not restored.

### Fails Analytic Necessitism.

At W0 there are four propositions, the subsets of its two outgoing arrows id and h. At W1 the outgoing arrows are the freely iterated s^n, so its full proposition domain is P(N). Fullness admits an actual complete ordered real field on that domain, including every subset in the completeness clause. Thus a Real_t is possible at W0, but no ordered field has a carrier in its four propositions. The necessary-Real_t consequent would imply actual Real_t by the identity arrow. Hence AN_t fails. This uses neither the old tt argument nor inextensibility. It applies to either individual setting and either signature in ZFC only. Full proof and direct sources: [proof](../writeups/analytic-necessitism-carrier-correction.md), section 3.

*Revised 2026-10-30 by GPT-6 Astra, prompted by Daniel Kodsi:* Preserved and withdrew the codomain-chain argument's all-type verdict; appended the independently supplied type-t counterexample in the ordinary ZFC settings. SOAN failure is derived rather than duplicated. Original certificate unchanged.

### Holds Analytic Necessitism, Second-Order Analytic Necessitism.

*Withdrawn 2026-10-30 by GPT-6 Astra, prompted by Daniel Kodsi: The stated hypotheses do not establish the native all-carrier AN/SOAN schemata. A structure at tt (or another selected carrier) does not answer an instance at e or t. A counterexample is the full one-object model on the countable monoid with an absorbing zero and fixed natural-number individuals, where an actual real field at t has no necessarily distinct carrier. See [proof](../writeups/analytic-necessitism-carrier-correction.md), sections 1–3, for the full countermodels and exact condition checks. The original text and attribution are preserved; its selected-carrier construction is not rejected by this withdrawal.*

At type $\tau:=et$, as analytic-necessitism-codomain-everywhere with the individuals in place of the propositions: the individuals are the same infinite set $D$ at every object, so the codomain-only intension $Y_A$ whose value at every arrow is $E^A$, for an injection $A\mapsto E^A$ from the sets of natural numbers into the sets of individuals, is in the domain, and its transports are the $Y_A$ of the targets, distinct for distinct $A$; the real number structure on the $Y_A$ by codomain-only relations is carried along every arrow to an isomorphic one. Such a structure is rigid, its instances are necessarily distinct, and it is necessarily a real number structure; and the codomain-only intension of type $((\tau)^kt)t$ whose value at each object is the set of codomain-only $k$-ary relations among the carrier there is a represented power of arity $k$, since at every world each $k$-ary relation agrees on the carrier with one of them. So the consequents of Analytic Necessitism and of its second-order form hold, and both principles hold. (The argument of the withdrawn analytic-necessitism-unretracted-arrow would refute this structure; its step from inextensibility is the gap.)

*General argument `arguments/analytic-necessitism-codomain-fixed-infinite-individuals`. It requires that At every object reachable from the evaluation point, the domain contains every intension whose value at an arrow depends only on the arrow's codomain. Here: The domains are full at every object. It requires that At every object the individuals are the same infinite set, and every arrow acts on them as the identity. Here: This is the choice of individuals. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), prompted by Cian Dorr, auditing the withdrawn arguments for the failure of Analytic Necessitism, 2026-10-29.*

*Revised 2026-10-30 by GPT-6 Astra, prompted by Daniel Kodsi:* Withdrawn as an all-type sufficient-condition argument, following the 29 October counterexamples proved in the accompanying write-up. This does not assert failure of AN in every model formerly using this argument. Specific full-action replacements are proved in sections 4–5 of the linked write-up.

### Fails Analytic Necessitism.

*Withdrawn 2026-10-29 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), prompted by Cian Dorr, after a trawl subagent's report: The step from $k\cdot y=k\cdot x\in X_k$ to $Xy$ (or $y\in X_h$) by inextensibility does not follow: inextensibility bounds a rigid carrier from above, by the transports of its actual instances, and puts nothing new into its actual extension. The conclusion is false in many of the models the argument was applied to: entities fixed by every arrow, or transported injectively, can carry a rigid real number structure that is necessarily one (see analytic-necessitism-codomain-fixed and analytic-necessitism-full-continuum).*

As in the argument analytic-necessitism-unretracted-arrow, with the individuals supplying the real numbers in place of the propositions. Let $k$ be an arrow out of the evaluation object $w$ with no retraction; as there, the model being full, no entity of a relational type at $w$ is determined by its transport along $k$, so no rigid real number structure of a relational type at $w$ is necessarily a real number structure. But there is a real number structure at $w$ of the relational type $((et)t)t$: the individuals at $w$ are infinitely many, the sets of sets of individuals are Dedekind-infinite (a theorem of ZF for any infinite set), so the entities of type $(et)t$, which include one with any given set of properties of individuals as extension at the identity, include a copy of the natural numbers, and the entities of type $((et)t)t$ a copy of the sets of natural numbers, hence of the reals; the full domains equip that copy, at the identity, with the order, sum, product and natural numbers of the reals, and the structure is complete, every subset of its carrier being the extension of a subproperty. So the antecedent of Analytic Necessitism holds at that type and its consequent fails: Analytic Necessitism fails. No choice is used.

*General argument `arguments/analytic-necessitism-unretracted-arrow-individuals`. It requires that The model is a full action model: an action model (Classicism, Appendix D) that is full at every object. Here: An action model, full at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59; Appendix D). It requires that Some arrow out of the evaluation object has no retraction. Here: There is no arrow from $W_1$ back to $W_0$. It requires that There are infinitely many individuals at the evaluation world. Here: $D$ is infinite. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Zachary Goodsell, 2026-10-23.*

### Holds Arithmetic Necessitism.

The numbers at a type $\sigma$ are the instances of $\mathbb N_\sigma$, the least property containing $\mathbf 0_\sigma$ and closed under $\operatorname{Suc}_\sigma$ (Background); the numerals $\mathbf 0_\sigma$, $\operatorname{Suc}_\sigma\mathbf 0_\sigma,\ldots$ are closed terms, so each denotes at every object, and transport along an arrow carries its denotation at the source to its denotation at the target. At any object $v$ reachable from the evaluation point, extensional fullness gives a property whose extension at $v$ is exactly the numerals there; it contains $\mathbf 0_\sigma$ and is closed under successor, so the numbers at $v$ are exactly the numerals, every numeral being an instance of every inductive property. Persistence of $\mathbb N_\sigma$ and, given $\Box I^*_\sigma$, the necessary distinctness of the numbers are theorems of C (the proof of necessary-rigid-comprehension-implies-arithmetic-necessitism). Inextensibility, $\Box\forall X\,.\,(\forall n\,.\,\mathbb N_\sigma n\to\Box Xn)\to\mathbb N_\sigma\le X$: at a reachable $v$ and for an arrow $j$ from $v$ to $u$, the numbers at $u$ are the numerals there, which are the transports along $j$ of the numbers at $v$, so any $X$ that necessarily holds of the numbers at $v$ holds at $u$ of the numbers there. So $\mathbb N_\sigma$ is rigid, and Arithmetic Necessitism holds at every type. No choice is used.

*General argument `arguments/arithmetic-necessitism-extensionally-full`. It requires that The model is extensionally full at every object: every set of tuples from the domains at an object is the extension, at the identity arrow, of an element of the domain of the matching relational type there. Here: A full model contains every intension, so in particular one with any given extension at the identity. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Zachary Goodsell, 2026-10-23.*

### Holds Truths are ND-necessary.

For a true $p$, $a\le p$, since $a$ entails every truth. Take $q:=a$ in the definition of $\Box_{\ne}p$: at a world in $a$, $p$ holds; at a world outside $a$, $\Diamond a$ fails. So every truth is $\Box_{\ne}$-necessary.

*General argument `arguments/dpc-isolated-actual-world`. It requires that The actual-world proposition $a$ is in the domain and entails every truth, and no world outside $a$ sees a world in $a$. Here: The actual-world proposition, the singleton of the identity of $W_0$, is in the domain, the model being full; the only other world out of $W_0$ is $h$, and every arrow after $h$ is $h$ again, so no world outside it sees a world in it. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Cian Dorr, 2026-09-23.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The finite-support, symmetric and full action models' copies (eight records) stated once for the topic; what varied, why no world outside the actual world sees back into it, is each record's reason for meeting actual-world-isolated.

### Fails Infinity Schema (type t), Axiom of Infinity (type t).

The propositions at the evaluation world are finitely many, and every intension of a full model is present, so the numerals are the finite cardinalities and one of them holds of the universal property of propositions: the Axiom of Infinity at type t fails, as does an instance of the schema.

*General argument `arguments/finitely-many-propositions`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that There are finitely many propositions at the evaluation world. Here: The propositions at $W_0$ are the subsets of the two arrows out of it, four in all. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-09-20.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The copies in three full action models (each with four propositions) stated once for the topic; each record's count is its reason for meeting finitely-many-propositions.

*Revised 2026-10-06 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The Axiom of Infinity's failure, which the text states, recorded as a verdict of its own, so that it is certified without the result that the Axiom implies the schema.

### Holds □Truths are 5-necessary.

In a full action model the actual-world proposition $\{1\}$ is in the domain at every object. Taking it as the witness, $\Box_{\ne}p$ holds at an identity iff $p$ contains every arrow out of that object with a retraction (these are the arrows at which $\Diamond\{1\}$ holds), and $\hat{\hat\Box}p$ iff $p$ contains every invertible arrow out of it (an arrow lies in $\hat\Diamond\{1\}$ iff some retraction of it has a retraction, i.e. iff it is invertible). Full models satisfy necessary Actuality, so $\Box_5=\hat{\hat\Box}$ by Proposition D21 of The Bounds of Possibility. With only identities invertible, $\Box_5$ is the identity operator at every reachable object, so every truth is 5-necessary everywhere.

*General argument `arguments/five-necessity-trivial-isomorphisms`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that Out of every object reachable from the evaluation point, the identity is the only invertible arrow. Here: The only invertible arrows are the identities: $s^m\circ s^n=s^0$ only for $m=n=0$, and $h$ has no inverse. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-14.*

### Holds □Atomicity.

Entailment is inclusion of intensions. Below a relation $Y\ne\bot_\tau$ lies the relation whose intension is the singleton of one of $Y$'s tuples, which is in the domain since the model is full, and is an atom: its only proper part is $\bot_\tau$. Every object being full, the same holds at every arrow, so Atomicity is necessary. The source notes that full models are atomic (p. 61); stated once for the topic, in place of the full models' own arguments.

*Source: Classicism, p. 61. General argument `arguments/full-atomicity`. It requires that The model is a full action model: an action model (Classicism, Appendix D) that is full at every object. Here: An action model, full at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59; Appendix D). By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Holds □Self-atoms are atoms.

The argument of full-comparable-free-arrows-self-atoms at every reachable object: a self-atom there is a singleton intension, so an atom.

*General argument `arguments/full-comparable-free-arrows-everywhere-self-atoms`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that At every object reachable from the evaluation point, any two arrows out of it that are each fixed under post-composition only by the identity are comparable: one is a left multiple of the other. Here: Out of $W_0$ only $1$ is fixed by nothing but the identity, $h$ being fixed by $s$; out of $W_1$ the arrows $s^n$ are comparable, $s^m=s^{m-n}\circ s^n$ for $n\le m$. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Cian Dorr, 25 October 2026.*

### Fails Self-Atomicity (type t), Atoms are self-atoms (type t).

Let $m\ne1$ fix $k$: $m\circ k=k$. The singleton $\{k\}$, in the domain since the model is full, is an atom. Its transport along $k$ is $\{x : x\circ k=k\}$, which contains $1$ and $m$, and the proposition $\{1\}$ at $k$’s target, in the domain there, separates them; so $\{k\}$ is true at $k$ without being an atom there, and it is not a self-atom. As $\{k\}$ is the only possible proposition below itself, Self-Atomicity (type t) fails too.

*General argument `arguments/full-fixed-arrow-no-self-atom`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that Some arrow $k$ out of the evaluation object is fixed by a non-identity arrow: $m\circ k=k$ with $m\ne1$. Here: $s\circ h=h$ with $s\ne1_{W_1}$. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Cian Dorr, 25 October 2026.*

### Holds □Rigid Comprehension.

Given $X$ of type $\tau$ at an object $W$, let $Y$ be the relation whose extension at an arrow $i$ out of $W$ is $X$'s extension at $W$ transported along $i$, which is in the domain since the model is full. It is coextensive with $X$. It is persistent, since its extension at $i\circ j$ is its extension at $i$ transported along $j$. And it is inextensible: if $\Box X'$ holds at $i$ of everything $Y$ holds of there, then at $i\circ j$ everything $Y$ holds of is the transport along $j$ of something $Y$ holds of at $i$, of which $X'$ then holds. Every object being full, the same holds at every arrow, so Rigid Comprehension is necessary. The source notes that full models satisfy it (p. 61); stated once for the topic, in place of the full models' own arguments.

*Source: Classicism, p. 61. General argument `arguments/full-rigid-comprehension`. It requires that The model is a full action model: an action model (Classicism, Appendix D) that is full at every object. Here: An action model, full at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59; Appendix D). By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Holds □Self-atoms are strong atoms.

The argument of full-uniquely-factored-self-atoms-strong at every reachable object.

*General argument `arguments/full-uniquely-factored-everywhere-self-atoms-strong`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that At every object reachable from the evaluation point, any two arrows out of it that are each fixed under post-composition only by the identity are comparable: one is a left multiple of the other. Here: Out of $W_0$ only $1$ is fixed by nothing but the identity, $h$ being fixed by $s$; out of $W_1$ the arrows $s^n$ are comparable, $s^m=s^{m-n}\circ s^n$ for $n\le m$. It requires that At every object reachable from the evaluation point, every arrow $k$ out of it that is fixed only by the identity factors through each arrow $h$ out of it in at most one way: $m\circ h=m^{\prime}\circ h=k$ implies $m=m^{\prime}$. Here: At $W_0$, $1=m\circ h$ is impossible and $1=m\circ1$ forces $m=1$; at $W_1$, $s^n=m\circ s^a$ forces $m=s^{n-a}$. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Cian Dorr, 25 October 2026.*

### Holds Axiom of Infinity (type e), Infinity Schema (type e).

The Infinity schema holds, there being $n$ distinct individuals for every $n$. For the Axiom: by extensional fullness the domain has a property of cardinalities true of $Z$ exactly when every property $Z$ holds of has a finite extension. It holds of $\mathbf{0}_e$, which holds only of empty properties, and passes from $Y$ to $\operatorname{Suc}_e Y$, which holds of $F$ only if $Y$ holds of $F$ less one of its instances. So every finite cardinality has it, and none holds of the universal property, whose extension is infinite.

*General argument `arguments/infinitely-many-individuals`. It requires that The model is extensionally full at every object: every set of tuples from the domains at an object is the extension, at the identity arrow, of an element of the domain of the matching relational type there. Here: A full model contains every intension, so in particular one with any given extension at the identity. It requires that There are infinitely many individuals at the evaluation world. Here: $D$ is infinite. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Holds □Intensional Choice.

For each object $U$ and type $\sigma$ fix a well-ordering $<_U$ of the domain $D^\sigma_U$, and let $W$ be the intension of type $\sigma\to\sigma\to t$ with $W(h):={<_{\operatorname{cod}h}}$. Its value depends only on the arrow's codomain, so by the condition it is in the domain, and at every world its extension well-orders that world's type-$\sigma$ domain. Given $F$ with $\Box\exists x\, .\,Fx$, put $G:=\lambda x\, .\,Fx\land\forall y\, .\,(Fy\to\neg Wyx)$, the $W$-least $F$. It is definable from $F$ and $W$, so in the domain; $G\le F$, and its extension at every arrow is the singleton of the least element of $F$'s. So Intensional Choice holds, and the same at every reachable object gives $\Box$Intensional Choice. Cian Dorr's observation that such models are qualitatively full, made precise.

*General argument `arguments/intensional-choice-well-ordering`. It requires that At every object reachable from the evaluation point, the domain contains every intension whose value at an arrow depends only on the arrow's codomain. Here: The domains are full at every object. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Cian Dorr, at Cian Dorr's suggestion, 2026-10-03.*

### Holds □Relational Choice, □Transversal Choice.

At any reachable object $W$, let $U$ be a serial relation in the domain there. Using the axiom of choice, pick for each $x$ a $y$ with $(x,y)$ in the extension of $U$ at the identity, and let $S$ be the intension whose value at every arrow $W\to W$ is the graph of this choice and whose value at arrows with any other codomain is empty; it depends only on the codomain, so the condition puts it in the domain, and at the identity it is a functional subrelation of $U$. Likewise a set of representatives of an equivalence relation at $W$, made into such an intension, is a transversal. Since $W$ was any reachable object, both principles hold at every world.

*General argument `arguments/necessary-relational-choice-codomain-intensions`. It requires that At every object reachable from the evaluation point, the domain contains every intension whose value at an arrow depends only on the arrow's codomain. Here: The domains are full at every object. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-14.*

### Fails Strong Atomicity (type t).

Let $k$ out of the evaluation object have distinct $j\ne j^{\prime}$ after it with $j\circ k= j^{\prime}\circ k$. The proposition $\{j\circ k\}$, in the domain since the model is full, is possible, and the only possible proposition below it is itself. It is not a strong atom: under $k$ it becomes $\{m : m\circ k=j\circ k\}$, which contains $j$ and $j^{\prime}$, and the proposition $\{j\}$ at $k$'s target, in the domain there, neither contains nor excludes it. So the type-$t$ Strong Atomicity fails. (The idempotent monoid's and the retract's own arguments of 22–23 September, stated once.)

*General argument `arguments/nonepic-strong-atomicity`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that Some arrow out of the evaluation object is not an epimorphism: two distinct arrows after it agree after it. Here: The distinct arrows $s^0$ and $s$ out of $W_1$ agree after $h$, both composites being $h$. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Fails Fregean Axiom.

The propositions $\top$ and $\{1\}$ are in the domain, the model being full; they are both true at the evaluation point and differ at the other arrow, so the Fregean Axiom fails.

*Source: Classicism, p. 61. General argument `arguments/nonidentity-arrow`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that Some arrow out of the evaluation object is not its identity. Here: The arrow $h$. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Holds □Relational Choice.

The truncation of a full action model at any arrow is again a full action model, its domains at the reachable objects being unchanged, and Relational Choice holds in every full model given choice in the metatheory (Classicism, p. 61).

*General argument `arguments/relational-choice-full-boxed`. It requires that The model is a full action model: an action model (Classicism, Appendix D) that is full at every object. Here: An action model, full at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59; Appendix D). By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Cian Dorr, 2026-09-22.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The two-object full action models' copies stated once for the topic, for every full action model.

### Holds Relational Choice.

With choice in the metatheory a serial relation has a functional subrelation, and a full model contains every intension, so that subrelation is in the domain; see Classicism, p. 61, on the principles common to full models.

*General argument `arguments/relational-choice-full`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-09-20.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The full action models' copies stated once for the topic.

### Holds Rigid Power, □Rigid Power.

Write $X_0(E)$ for the intension $k\mapsto k\cdot E$. The extension at an arrow $h$ of the power property $\lambda X\, .\,\operatorname{Rigid}(X)\land X\le F$ is the set of rigid $X$ with $X\le h\cdot F$, the bound variable ranging over the domain untransported and the parameter transported. By the condition the rigid relations are the $X_0(E)$, and $X_0(T)\le X_0(S)$ iff $T\subseteq S$; so for rigid $F=X_0(S)$ the power property has extension $\{X_0(T'):T'\subseteq k\cdot S\}$ at $k$, while transporting its extension at the identity along $k$ gives $\{X_0(k\cdot T):T\subseteq S\}$. These coincide, since every $T'\subseteq k\cdot S$ is $k\cdot T$ for $T:=\{s\in S:k\cdot s\in T'\}$. So the power property is itself $X_0$ of its extension, hence rigid, and the same at every reachable object gives the boxed form.

*General argument `arguments/rigid-power-tight`. It requires that At every object reachable from the evaluation point, the rigid relations of each relational type are exactly the intensions $k\mapsto k\cdot E$, the disjunctions of the haecceities of the members of $E$, for $E$ any set of tuples from the domains there; in particular every such intension is in the domain. Here: Every intension is present, so for any set $E$ the intension $k\mapsto k\cdot E$ is in the domain, and a relation is weakly inextensible at a world iff it lies below that intension over its extension there, since that is the smallest intension satisfying the hypothesis; with persistence, a rigid relation equals it (the argument deferred in extraction.md, 3 October 2026). By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), prompted by Cian Dorr, 3 October 2026 (full action models); extended by Claude Fable 5.1, prompted by Cian Dorr (Anthropic), 4 October 2026, at Cian Dorr's direction.*

*Revised 2026-10-04 by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The argument deferred in extraction.md on 3 October for the full action models, where every intension is present, stated under the condition it actually uses, which the symmetry-constrained full models also meet.

### Holds Necessity of Second-Order Analysis.

Let $v$ be any object reachable from the evaluation point and $\mathfrak R$ a real number structure at $v$ (Background, Analysis). Its completeness is tested against the subproperties of its carrier present at $v$, and by extensional fullness every subset of the carrier's extension there is the extension at the identity of one of them; so the carrier, with the extensions of $\le$, $+$ and $\times$, is a complete ordered field in the sense of the metatheory and, by Huntington's theorem, a theorem of ZF, is isomorphic to the real numbers. For the same reason the extension of $N$, the least subproperty containing $0$ and closed under adding $1$, is its set of natural numbers, that set being the extension of a subproperty. A second-order analytical sentence $A(\mathfrak R)$ quantifies over the relations among entities of the structure's type at $v$, applied to the structure's elements, and their extensions at the identity are all the relations on the carrier, again by extensional fullness. So $A(\mathfrak R)$ holds at $v$ exactly when $A$ holds in the real numbers under full second-order semantics, which depends neither on $v$ nor on $\mathfrak R$. Hence $\Box\forall\mathfrak R\,.\,\operatorname{Real}_\sigma(\mathfrak R)\to A(\mathfrak R)$ holds when $A$ is true of the reals and $\Box\forall\mathfrak R\,.\,\operatorname{Real}_\sigma(\mathfrak R)\to\neg A(\mathfrak R)$ when it is false: every instance of the Necessity of Second-Order Analysis holds, and with it the Necessity of Analysis and the Non-contingency of the Continuum Hypothesis, as recorded. No choice is used.

*General argument `arguments/second-order-analysis-extensionally-full`. It requires that The model is extensionally full at every object: every set of tuples from the domains at an object is the extension, at the identity arrow, of an element of the domain of the matching relational type there. Here: A full model contains every intension, so in particular one with any given extension at the identity. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Zachary Goodsell, 2026-10-23.*

### Fails Witnessed Possibility, Separated Structure, Independence (signature Σ), Maximalism (signature Σ).

Let $c\in\Sigma$ have relational type $\tau$, so $c=\top_\tau$ necessarily. Witnessed Possibility fails for the pure formula $x\ne\top_\tau$, witnessed by $\bot_\tau$ but impossible of $c$; Separated Structure fails since $\lambda x\, .\,x$ and $\lambda x\, .\,\top_\tau$ agree on $c$ and differ; Independence (signature Σ) fails since $c$ denotes what the closed pure term $\top_\tau$ denotes; Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ) fails since $c=\top_\tau$ is a true identity that C(Σ) does not prove.

*General argument `arguments/sigma-top`. It requires that Every constant of Σ is relational, and each denotes the top element of its type. Here: This is the interpretation. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr’s request, 2026-09-22.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Moved from the group finite-support-one-object to the topic; it uses nothing about the model.

### Holds Transversal Choice.

For an equivalence relation at the evaluation point, a transversal of its extension there, chosen in the metatheory, is by extensional fullness the extension of an element of the domain; the equivalence and transversal conditions are unboxed.

*General argument `arguments/transversal-choice-extensionally-full`. It requires that The model is extensionally full at every object: every set of tuples from the domains at an object is the extension, at the identity arrow, of an element of the domain of the matching relational type there. Here: A full model contains every intension, so in particular one with any given extension at the identity. By Cian Dorr (observation); recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), on a question of Zachary Goodsell, after an observation of Christopher Sun, 2026-09-25.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The Relational Choice and Transversal Choice arguments merged into one, stated for every extensionally full model.

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Moved from the group finite-support-one-object to the topic. Its first sentence, deriving extensional fullness from ideal fullness, is now the group's reason for meeting extensionally-full.

### Holds □Two-hat necessities are ND-necessary.

In a full action model the actual-world proposition $\{1\}$ is in the domain at every object. Taking it as the witness, $\Box_{\ne}p$ holds at an identity iff $p$ contains every arrow out of that object with a retraction (these are the arrows at which $\Diamond\{1\}$ holds), and $\hat{\hat\Box}p$ iff $p$ contains every invertible arrow out of it (an arrow lies in $\hat\Diamond\{1\}$ iff some retraction of it has a retraction, i.e. iff it is invertible). Full models satisfy necessary Actuality, so $\Box_5=\hat{\hat\Box}$ by Proposition D21 of The Bounds of Possibility. When every retracted arrow is invertible, the two boxes coincide at every reachable object, so $\Box_{\ne}=\hat{\hat\Box}$.

*General argument `arguments/two-hat-nd-retracted-invertible`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that Out of every object reachable from the evaluation point, every arrow that has a retraction is invertible. Here: No arrow other than an identity has a retraction, for the same reason. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-14.*

### Fails ND (type t).

Let $k$ out of the evaluation object have no retraction. The propositions $\bot$ and $\{1\}$ are in the domain, the model being full, and $k$ transports both to $\bot$: no arrow $m$ after $k$ has $m\circ k=1$. So $k$'s action at type $t$ is not injective, and ND fails there (Proposition 3.24(i)).

*Source: Classicism, §3.5, Proposition 3.24(i). General argument `arguments/unretracted-arrow`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that Some arrow out of the evaluation object has no retraction. Here: There is no arrow from $W_1$ back to $W_0$. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*


## Notes

The two-object chain with an infinite monoid of endomorphisms at the second object. It is recorded to refute the conjecture possible-infinity-t-implies-axiom-of-infinity-t: the evaluation object has four propositions and sees one with infinitely many. As the conjecture's notes anticipate, BF at type $t$ and No Pure Contingency both fail; the engine derives both from Possible Infinity (type $t$) and the failure of the Axiom of Infinity (type $t$), and they can be seen directly: transport along $h$ sends a proposition $p$ at $W_0$ to every arrow out of $W_1$ if $h\in p$ and to none otherwise, so the property of propositions whose extension at $h$ is $\{\emptyset,\{s^n:n\ge0\}\}$ and whose extension at the identity is everything necessarily holds of every proposition at $W_0$ and fails at $W_1$ of $\{s\}$; and the pure sentence that there are exactly four propositions is true at $W_0$ and false at $W_1$. With one individual the model is finite at $W_0$ in every type, and infinite at $W_1$ from type $t$ up.

Clarification (30 October 2026; GPT-6 Astra, prompted by Daniel Kodsi): the final sentence of the original notes overstates finiteness at W0. Only its proposition domain is four-element; already at type tt an arbitrary subset of D_t(W1) can be chosen as the h-row, giving infinitely many root entities. The new negative argument uses precisely the t instance and does not assert all-type finiteness.
