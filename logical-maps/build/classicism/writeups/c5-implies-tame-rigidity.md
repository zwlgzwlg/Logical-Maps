# □ND ⇒ Tame Rigidity

## Premises

- **□ND.** Necessarily, distinct things of any type are necessarily distinct.

## Conclusion

- **Tame Rigidity.** Every weakly rigid relation, including a proposition, is rigid.

## Proof

C5 gives BF at every type (via □BF and T) and 5; 4 is a theorem of C. Contraposing with $\neg X$ for $X$, weak inextensibility of $F$ is equivalent to $\forall X\, .\,\Diamond\exists\bar x\, .\,(F[\bar x]\land X[\bar x])\to\exists\bar x\, .\,(F[\bar x]\land\Diamond X[\bar x])$, and inextensibility to its necessitation. Suppose for contradiction that $F$ is weakly rigid but not rigid. Weak rigidity includes persistence, so $F$ is not inextensible: $\Diamond\exists X\, .\,\bigl(\Diamond\exists\bar x\, .\,(F[\bar x]\land X[\bar x])\land\neg\exists\bar x\, .\,(F[\bar x]\land\Diamond X[\bar x])\bigr)$. By BF at the type of $X$ there is an $X$ such that $\Diamond\Diamond\exists\bar x\, .\,(F[\bar x]\land X[\bar x])$, hence by 4 $\Diamond\exists\bar x\, .\,(F[\bar x]\land X[\bar x])$, and also $\Diamond\neg\exists\bar x\, .\,(F[\bar x]\land\Diamond X[\bar x])$. Since $F$ is weakly inextensible, the former gives $\exists\bar x\, .\,(F[\bar x]\land\Diamond X[\bar x])$. For such $\bar x$, the persistence of $F$ (with T) gives $\Box F[\bar x]$, and 5 gives $\Box\Diamond X[\bar x]$. So $\Box(F[\bar x]\land\Diamond X[\bar x])$, and by K applied to the necessitated theorem $(F[\bar x]\land\Diamond X[\bar x])\to\exists\bar y\, .\,(F[\bar y]\land\Diamond X[\bar y])$, $\Box\exists\bar y\, .\,(F[\bar y]\land\Diamond X[\bar y])$, contradicting the second conjunct.

## Notes

The argument uses BF and 5 only at the evaluation point, together with T and 4.
