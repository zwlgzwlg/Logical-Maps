# Vicinity ∧ Distinctness-preserving collapse ⇒ Actuality

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Misc., Lean `Classicism.Map.vicinity_and_distinctness_preserving_collapse_imply_actuality`; produced by Cian Dorr, 27 September 2026; recorded by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), 27 September 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **Vicinity.** There is a true proposition that entails the possibility of each true proposition.
- **Distinctness-preserving collapse.** Every truth is necessary under the distinctness-preserving modality.

## Conclusion

- **Actuality.** There is a true proposition that entails every true proposition.

## Proof

Let $w$ witness Vicinity; we show that $w$ itself witnesses Actuality. Let $p$ be true. Distinctness-preserving collapse gives $\Box_{\ne}p$, that is, a true $q$ with $\Box(\Diamond q\to p)$, i.e. $\Diamond q\le p$. Since $q$ is true, Vicinity gives $w\le\Diamond q$. So $w\le p$.

## Notes

The witness is the same proposition. With Actuality ⇒ Vicinity, Actuality is equivalent to Vicinity under Distinctness-preserving collapse, as it is under Weakly Inextensible Comprehension.
