# Plenitude ⇒ Actuality

## Premises

- **Plenitude.** Every total single-valued binary relation is represented by an operation. Its output type is relational, as required by the type system.

## Conclusion

- **Actuality.** There is a true proposition that entails every true proposition.

## Proof

Use the functional relation taking each true proposition to itself and each false proposition to $\top$: $(p\land p=q)\lor(\neg p\land q=\top)$. Plenitude supplies Z with those values. The proposition $\forall p\, .\,Zp$ is true and entails Zp for every p, hence entails every true p. It witnesses Actuality.

## Notes

The displayed relation in the PDF’s prose on p. 33 has p=top in its second disjunct. The surrounding definition and subsequent proof require q=top. This transcription explicitly follows that intended truth-to-itself/falsehood-to-top construction.
