## Package

- **□Atomicity.** Necessarily, every non-bottom entity of each relational type has an atom below it.
- **□Boolean Completeness.** Necessarily, every property of entities of a relational type has a greatest lower bound in that type.
- **□BF.** Necessarily, the Barcan Formula holds at every type. The predicate formulation closes the formula schema using lambda abstraction.
- **□Intensional Choice.** Every closed instance of Intensional Choice is necessary. Box the entire object-variable closure; retain the same type range and other schema side conditions.
- **□Rigid Power.** Every closed instance of Rigid Power is necessary. Box the entire object-variable closure; retain the same type range and other schema side conditions.
- **□Transversal Choice.** Necessarily, every equivalence relation, at any type including e, has a transversal, that is, a property with exactly one instance in each of its cells.
- **Distinctness-preserving collapse.** Every truth is necessary under the distinctness-preserving modality.
- **Axiom of Infinity (type t).** There are not finitely many propositions. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **Infinity Schema (type t).** There are arbitrarily many pairwise distinct entities of this fixed type; one sentence for each positive integer n.
- **Countable Boolean Completeness.** Every countable property of entities of a relational type has a least upper bound in that type, where a property is countable when it injects into the natural numbers.
- **Transversal Choice.** Every equivalence relation, at any type including e, has a transversal, that is, a property with exactly one instance in each of its cells.
- **¬ Rigid Comprehension.** Every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a rigid one.
- **¬ B for pure sentences.** The B instance for every closed sentence in the pure language.
- **¬ Axiom of Infinity (type e).** There are not finitely many individuals. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **¬ Infinity Schema (type e).** There are arbitrarily many pairwise distinct entities of this fixed type; one sentence for each positive integer n.
- **¬ Possible Infinity (type e).** Possibly there are not finitely many individuals: the Axiom of Infinity at this type, under a diamond.
- **¬ Witnessed Possibility.** For pure-formulas P with free variables among a finite tuple x, and distinct matching nonlogical constants c, a witness to P entails that P at those constants is possible.
- **¬ Separated Structure.** For each typed nonlogical constant c and closed same-typed terms F,G not containing c, equality after application to c implies equality of F and G.
- **¬ Independence (signature Σ).** No constant of Sigma is a pure operation applied to other constants: for a closed pure term A and distinct constants c, d_1,…,d_n with n ≥ 0, c differs from A applied to the d’s. With n = 0, no constant denotes a pure entity.
- **¬ Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ).** The Distinctness Maximalism schema for the fixed nonlogical signature Sigma.

## Definition

An intensional action model with one individual. The objects are the root $o$, $s$, $u$, and $n$ for each $n\ge1$; besides identities the arrows are $h_s\colon o\to s$, $j\colon s\to u$, $h_u:=j\circ h_s$ and $h_n\colon o\to n$, so the root reaches each object by exactly one arrow and worlds may be identified with objects. The domains at $s$, $u$ and each $n$ are full. Identify the domains at the terminal objects $u$ and $n$ with one finite full type structure $M$ over one individual. Fix a non-principal ultrafilter $\mathcal U$ on the positive integers. At the root, an element of a relational type is any element of the full intension space whose extension at $u$ is the $\mathcal U$-limit of its extensions at the worlds $n$; its extensions at $o$, at $s$ and at each $n$ are unconstrained. So a root proposition is any choice of truth values at $o$, $s$ and the $n$s, with its value at $u$ fixed as the limit. Evaluation point: the root. Interpretation of Σ, fixed for this record: every constant of Σ is relational, and each denotes the top element of its type.

## Arguments

### Holds □Atomicity, □Boolean Completeness.

At the root, the map sending an element to its extensions at $o$, $s$ and the $n$s is an order isomorphism onto a product of powerset algebras, the extension at $u$ being recomputed as the limit. So every family has a meet and a join, computed coordinatewise except at $u$, and every nonzero element lies above an atom with one tuple in one free coordinate. The other worlds carry finite full powerset algebras. Hence Boolean Completeness and Atomicity hold at every world and every relational type.

### Holds □BF.

Every arrow acts surjectively at every type, so BF holds at every world (write-up, Proposition 4).

### Fails Rigid Comprehension.

At type $t\to t$ (write-up, Theorem 6). Let $A_0$ be the root propositions false at $s$ and at $u$, and $X$ the property with extension $A_0$ at the root and empty extensions elsewhere. A persistent property coextensive with $X$ contains both truth values at every world $n$, since members of $A_0$ take both values there; the limit condition then puts the true proposition in its extension at $u$. Rigidity at the root forces its extension at $s$ to be the proposition false at $s$ and $u$, and rigidity at $s$, tested against that proposition's haecceity, forbids the true proposition at $u$. The least upper bound of the haecceities of the $X$s, the candidate rigid coextension in the proof of Proposition 2.11, is weakly rigid but fails the rigidity condition at $s$. The model therefore refutes Proposition 2.11 (necessary-atomicity-completeness-bf-imply-rigid-comprehension); the gap is the normalization step of n. 42, part (iv), which the write-up runs inside the model (§5).

### Holds □Intensional Choice.

At the root: given $F$ with $\Box\exists x\, .\,Fx$, let $G$ pick the least element of $F$ at $o$, $s$ and each $n$, under fixed well-orderings, the same ordering of $M^\sigma$ at every $n$. The sets $\{n : G(n)=\{a\}\}$ for $a\in M^\sigma$ partition the positive integers into finitely many pieces, so exactly one is in $\mathcal U$, say for $a_0$; then $\lim_{\mathcal U}G(n)=\{a_0\}$, and $a_0\in F(u)=\lim_{\mathcal U}F(n)$. Setting $G(u):=\{a_0\}$ puts $G$ in the root domain, with $G\le F$ and every extension a singleton. At $s$, $u$ and the $n$ the domains are full, and the well-ordering argument (arguments/intensional-choice-well-ordering) applies there, so the boxed form holds too.

### Holds □Rigid Power.

At every relational type and every world. Write $k\cdot E$ for the transport of a set $E$ of tuples along an arrow $k$, and $X_0(E)$ for the relation $k\mapsto k\cdot E$, the disjunction of the haecceities of the members of $E$. At $s$, $u$ and each $n$ the model is full, and Rigid Power holds there as in every full model (arguments/rigid-power-tight). At the root, call a set $E$ of root tuples admissible when $X_0(E)$ is in the domain, that is, when $h_u\cdot E$ is the $\mathcal U$-limit of the sets $h_n\cdot E$ (subsets of a finite set, so the limit is the set taken at $\mathcal U$-many $n$). Since each member of $E$ has its value at $u$ as the limit of its values at the $n$, $h_u\cdot E$ is always included in that limit; and every finite $E$ is admissible, the finitely many limits being attained together at $\mathcal U$-many $n$.

(1) The rigid relations at the root are exactly the $X_0(E)$ with $E$ admissible. Such an $X_0(E)$, being in the domain, is rigid: it is persistent, and at every world $w$ it is $X_0(w\cdot E)$ there, included in every $X$ that necessarily holds of the members of $w\cdot E$. Conversely let $Y$ be rigid with extension $E$. Persistence gives $Y_k\supseteq k\cdot E$ at every arrow $k$. The root element $X$ with extensions $E$ at $o$, $h_s\cdot E$ at $s$, $h_n\cdot E$ at each $n$, and the limit at $u$, necessarily holds of every member of $E$ (its extension at $u$ includes $h_u\cdot E$, by the above), so inextensibility at the root gives $Y\le X$: $Y$ has extension $h_s\cdot E$ at $s$ and $h_n\cdot E$ at each $n$. Rigidity at $s$, in the full model on $s$ and $u$, makes the extension of $Y$ at $u$ the transport $j\cdot(h_s\cdot E)=h_u\cdot E$, and since $Y$ is in the domain that is also the limit of the $h_n\cdot E$. So $E$ is admissible and $Y=X_0(E)$.

(2) Let $F=X_0(S)$ be rigid at the root, and $P:=\lambda X\, .\,\operatorname{Rigid}(X)\land X\le F$, in the domain since it is definable from $F$. By (1) its extension at the root is $E_P:=\{X_0(T) : T\subseteq S\text{ admissible}\}$, and at a world $k$ among $s$, $u$ and the $n$ it is the set of rigid relations there below $k\cdot F$, which in those full models are the $X_0(T')$ with $T'\subseteq k\cdot S$. Each such $T'$ is finite, the domains there being finite, so it is $k\cdot T$ for a finite, hence admissible, $T\subseteq S$ (one preimage for each member), and $X_0(T')=k\cdot X_0(T)$. So the extension of $P$ at every $k$ is $k\cdot E_P$: $P=X_0(E_P)$, a rigid relation. Hence Rigid Power holds at the root, and so at every world.

### Holds □Transversal Choice.

At the root by the general argument transversal-choice-extensionally-full, the model being extensionally full there; at $s$, $u$ and each $n$ by the same argument, those worlds' domains being full and so extensionally full.

*Address: `ultralimit-fork#transversal-choice-everywhere`. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-08.*

### Holds Distinctness-preserving collapse.

For a true $p$, $a\le p$, since $a$ entails every truth. Take $q:=a$ in the definition of $\Box_{\ne}p$: at a world in $a$, $p$ holds; at a world outside $a$, $\Diamond a$ fails. So every truth is $\Box_{\ne}$-necessary.

*General argument `arguments/dpc-isolated-actual-world`. It requires that The actual-world proposition $a$ is in the domain and entails every truth, and no world outside $a$ sees a world in $a$. Here: The proposition true at $o$ alone (false at $s$, at every $n$, and so in the limit at $u$) is in the root domain and entails every truth, every true proposition being true at $o$; no world other than $o$ sees $o$. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-23.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The finite-support, symmetric and full action models' copies (eight records) stated once for the topic; what varied, why no world outside the actual world sees back into it, is each record's reason for meeting actual-world-isolated.

### Fails B for pure sentences.

The pure sentence $\exists p_1\ldots p_n\bigwedge_{i<j}p_i\ne p_j$ is true at the evaluation object and false at the world $V$ after it and at every world after $V$; so $\Diamond$ of it is false at $V$, and $\Box\Diamond$ of it false at the evaluation object. (The chain's own argument of 25 September, stated once.)

*General argument `arguments/fewer-propositions-after`. It requires that For some $n$, the evaluation object has $n$ distinct propositions, while some world after it, and every world after that one, has fewer. Here: The root has at least three distinct propositions, while each world $n$, which sees only itself, has two. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Holds Axiom of Infinity (type t), Infinity Schema (type t).

As for individuals (the argument infinitely-many-individuals), at type $t$: the Infinity schema holds, and by extensional fullness the property of cardinalities that hold only of properties with finite extensions is in the domain, has every finite cardinality, and excludes those holding of the universal property of propositions, whose extension is infinite.

*General argument `arguments/infinitely-many-propositions`. It requires that The model is extensionally full at every object: every set of tuples from the domains at an object is the extension, at the identity arrow, of an element of the domain of the matching relational type there. Here: At the root an element's extension at $o$ is unconstrained, so every set of tuples is the extension there of an element of the domain; the domains at $s$, $u$ and each $n$ are full. It requires that There are infinitely many propositions at the evaluation world. Here: A root proposition is any choice of truth values at $o$, $s$ and the $n$s, so there are infinitely many. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Fails Axiom of Infinity (type e), Infinity Schema (type e), Possible Infinity (type e).

No two individuals are distinct, and the numeral $\operatorname{Suc}_e\mathbf{0}_e$ holds of the universal property at type $e$ at every world.

*General argument `arguments/one-individual`. It requires that There is exactly one individual, at every world. Here: The definition fixes one individual, at every world. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-02.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Moved from the group finite-support-one-object to the topic.

### Fails Witnessed Possibility, Separated Structure, Independence (signature Σ), Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ).

Let $c\in\Sigma$ have relational type $\tau$, so $c=\top_\tau$ necessarily. Witnessed Possibility fails for the pure formula $x\ne\top_\tau$, witnessed by $\bot_\tau$ but impossible of $c$; Separated Structure fails since $\lambda x\, .\,x$ and $\lambda x\, .\,\top_\tau$ agree on $c$ and differ; Independence (signature Σ) fails since $c$ denotes what the closed pure term $\top_\tau$ denotes; Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ) fails since $c=\top_\tau$ is a true identity that C(Σ) does not prove.

*General argument `arguments/sigma-top`. It requires that Every constant of Σ is relational, and each denotes the top element of its type. Here: This is the interpretation the definition fixes. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr’s request, 2026-09-22.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Moved from the group finite-support-one-object to the topic; it uses nothing about the model.

### Holds Countable Boolean Completeness.

The natural numbers are the finite cardinalities at type $e$ (Background, after Goodsell), and with a single individual there are three: $\mathbf{0}_e$, true of the empty property; $\operatorname{Suc}_e\mathbf{0}_e$, true of the universal one; and the empty cardinality, which is $\operatorname{Suc}_e$ of the second and of itself. By extensional fullness the property of being one of these three is in the domain, so it bounds natural numberhood. A countable property therefore has at most three members in its extension, and their join is its least upper bound.

*General argument `arguments/three-numbers`. It requires that There is exactly one individual, at every world. Here: The definition fixes one individual, at every world. It requires that The model is extensionally full at every object: every set of tuples from the domains at an object is the extension, at the identity arrow, of an element of the domain of the matching relational type there. Here: At the root an element's extension at $o$ is unconstrained, so every set of tuples is the extension there of an element of the domain; the domains at $s$, $u$ and each $n$ are full. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), on Cian Dorr's question whether the failure of Boolean Completeness at type $t$ refutes its countable form here, 2026-10-02.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Moved from the group finite-support-one-object to the topic.

### Holds Transversal Choice.

For an equivalence relation at the evaluation point, a transversal of its extension there, chosen in the metatheory, is by extensional fullness the extension of an element of the domain; the equivalence and transversal conditions are unboxed.

*General argument `arguments/transversal-choice-extensionally-full`. It requires that The model is extensionally full at every object: every set of tuples from the domains at an object is the extension, at the identity arrow, of an element of the domain of the matching relational type there. Here: At the root an element's extension at $o$ is unconstrained, so every set of tuples is the extension there of an element of the domain; the domains at $s$, $u$ and each $n$ are full. By Cian Dorr (observation); recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), on a question of Zachary Goodsell, after an observation of Christopher Sun, 2026-09-25.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The Relational Choice and Transversal Choice arguments merged into one, stated for every extensionally full model.

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Moved from the group finite-support-one-object to the topic. Its first sentence, deriving extensional fullness from ideal fullness, is now the group's reason for meeting extensionally-full.


## Notes

It is a model: the limit condition commutes with every finite operation, so every term denotes in the domains (write-up, Lemma 2).
