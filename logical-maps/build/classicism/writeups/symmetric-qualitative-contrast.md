# Symmetric ideally-full model: qualitative contrast

The Bacon–Dorr model at $W_0$ satisfies C5 and Plenitude but fails both
Relational Choice and Functional Choice. The choice failures below are a new
verification by OpenAI Codex (GPT-6), 24 September 2026, prompted by the
user's proposal to transfer Plenitude countermodels to Functional Choice.
The model itself is Bacon and Dorr's final construction in Appendix D of
*Classicism*, draft of 16 May 2023, p. 79.

## Construction and the relevant semantic facts

There are two objects $W_0,W_1$, each with individual domain $\mathbb N$.
The arrows between any pair of objects are all bijections between these
copies, composed as functions. The individual action is the natural one.
Propositions at $W_i$ are the finitely supported sets of arrows out of
$W_i$ subject to the additional condition

$$
h\in p,\quad h:W_i\longrightarrow W_0
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
g\circ h\in p\quad\text{for every }g:W_0\longrightarrow W_0.
$$

Function types contain all finitely supported members of the corresponding
exponential action on these restricted domains. Here support has the sense
of Definitions D.1–D.3: if arrows with a common target agree on a finite
set $F$ of individuals, they have the same action on an entity supported
by $F$. In particular, any permutation fixing $F$ pointwise fixes that
entity. Application commutes with the actions, as in §3.4.

Two facts must be kept separate:

1. Every relation or operation has a finite support, although different
   entities may have different supports.
2. Every proposition $p\in W_0^t$ has constant truth value on the arrows
   $W_0\to W_0$: either it contains all those arrows or none. Thus, if a
   formula is true at $1_{W_0}$ with some parameters, it is true there
   again when all its parameters are transported by any such permutation.
   The parameters themselves need not be fixed by that permutation.

The second fact follows directly from the extra constraint, using inverses
for the converse. It is the reason this model differs from the ideally
full permutation model, where Relational Choice holds. An arbitrary
extension cannot be inserted at $W_0$ without respecting this constraint.

## A serial relation with no functional subrelation

For $P^{et}$, let $\operatorname{Two}(P)$ abbreviate

$$
\exists a^e b^e\, .\,a\ne b\land
\forall z^e\, .\,Pz\leftrightarrow(z=a\lor z=b).
$$

Fix an individual $d$. Ordinary comprehension gives the relation
$U^{(et)et}$ defined by

$$
(UP)x\quad\leftrightarrow\quad
\bigl(\operatorname{Two}(P)\land Px\bigr)
\lor\bigl(\neg\operatorname{Two}(P)\land x=d\bigr).
$$

It is serial at $W_0$: use a member of $P$ when it has exactly two members,
and $d$ otherwise. This is an admitted Relational Choice instance; a
relation may have individual outputs even though an operation may not.

Suppose $S^{(et)et}$ were a functional subrelation of $U$ at $W_0$.
Choose a finite support $F$ for $S$ and distinct $a,b$ outside
$F\cup\{d\}$. Put

$$
P_{a,b}:=\lambda z^e\, .\,z=a\lor z=b,
$$

and let $g$ transpose $a,b$, fixing every other individual. Then $gS=S$.
Also $gP_{a,b}=P_{a,b}$: transporting its parameters interchanges the two
disjuncts, which defines the same property by Logical Equivalence applied
to the H-theorem expressing commutativity of disjunction. This use of
Equivalence has no optional hypotheses.

Because $S$ is total and contained in $U$, its unique output at $P_{a,b}$
is one of $a,b$; call it $x$. Let $y$ be the other. The proposition
$(SP_{a,b})x$ is true at $1_{W_0}$. By the truth-invariance fact above,

$$
\bigl((gS)(gP_{a,b})\bigr)(gx)
=(SP_{a,b})y
$$

is true at $1_{W_0}$ as well. Both distinct individuals are therefore
$S$-outputs at the same input, contradicting functionality. Relational
Choice fails.

## Functional Choice with an admitted output type

The recorded theorem Functional Choice $\Rightarrow$ Relational Choice
already transfers this failure. Here is a direct relational-output
counterinstance, to make the type restriction explicit.

Write $H_x:=\lambda z^e\, .\,z=x$ for an individual's haecceity and define
$V^{(et)(et)t}$ by

$$
(VP)Q\quad\leftrightarrow\quad
\exists x^e\, .\,(UP)x\land Q=H_x.
$$

This relation is serial. If an operation $X^{(et)(et)}$ selected from it,
choose a finite support for $X$ and $a,b$ outside that support and
$\{d\}$. Again $gX=X$ and $gP_{a,b}=P_{a,b}$. Since the selected value is
either $H_a$ or $H_b$, equivariance of application would give

$$
XP_{a,b}=g(XP_{a,b})=H_y\ne H_x=XP_{a,b},
$$

where $x$ is the selected member and $y$ the other. The inequality is
literal inequality of domain elements: $H_a$ and $H_b$ differ on $a$ at
the identity arrow. This is a contradiction. The output type $et$ is
relational, so the counterinstance respects the map's type system.

Consequently the boxed forms of both choice principles fail too, by T.
No necessitation of an optional assumption is used.

## What transfers, and what remains open

Every arrow is invertible, giving C5 and the boxed Barcan schemata at all
types. The proposition consisting of all arrows $W_0\to W_0$ is the
least true proposition at $W_0$, giving Actuality. The source proves
that Actuality fails at $W_1$, so $\Box$Actuality and Atomicity fail at
$W_0$. The recorded implications from C5 plus Actuality give Boolean
Completeness and Rigid Comprehension, and hence Plenitude.

Thus even **C5 + Plenitude + Boolean Completeness + Rigid Comprehension**
does not imply Relational Choice or Functional Choice. The two Axioms of
Infinity already verified in the model can also be retained as premises.
These are countermodel claims, not incompatibility claims: other recorded
models satisfy those premises together with Functional Choice.

The general equivalence remains

$$
\text{Functional Choice}\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
\text{Relational Choice}\land\text{Plenitude}.
$$

It allows transfers when Relational Choice is verified. It does not allow
this model's failures of Atomicity and $\Box$Actuality to be transferred
to a model of Functional Choice. The corresponding implications with
Functional Choice as a premise remain unsettled by this verification.

## Check and attribution

`topics/classicism/checks/qualitative_contrast_choice.py` exhaustively
checks pair selectors on sets of two through five individuals. Every
selector requires a support containing all but at most one individual.
Finite sets still admit selectors; the contradiction in the countably
infinite construction is that every permitted support leaves two
individuals outside it. The finite check is a sanity check of the symmetry
obstruction, not a verification of the entire infinite higher-order model.

Construction and original positive and negative properties: Andrew Bacon
and Cian Dorr, *Classicism*, draft of 16 May 2023, §3.4 and Appendix D,
especially p. 79. The Relational Choice and Functional Choice failures
proved here are the new contribution; they have no independent checker
or Lean verification recorded.

## Additional arguments (25 September 2026)

The cited construction is a model of the map’s relational-type framework. The description identifies its evaluation point; construction and verification are given at the PDF locations in References. Interpretation of Σ, fixed for this record: each relational constant denotes the top element of its type and each individual constant denotes one fixed individual. Under it the signature schemata fail. Let $c\in\Sigma$ have relational type $\tau$, so $c=\top_\tau$ necessarily. Witnessed Possibility fails for the pure formula $x\ne\top_\tau$, witnessed by $\bot_\tau$ but impossible of $c$; Separated Structure fails since $\lambda x\, .\,x$ and $\lambda x\, .\,\top_\tau$ agree on $c$ and differ; Independence (signature Σ) fails since $c$ denotes what the closed pure term $\top_\tau$ denotes; Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ) fails since $c=\top_\tau$ is a true identity that C(Σ) does not prove. Everything that implies these fails with them. Distinctness-preserving collapse fails at $W_0$: every arrow has an inverse, so $\Diamond q$ holds at every arrow for every true $q$, and $\Box(\Diamond q\to p)$ would force every true $p$ to contain every arrow; but the true proposition consisting of all arrows $W_0\to W_0$ together with the arrows into $W_1$ fixing $0$ is pinned down by $\{0\}$, meets the closure constraint, and omits arrows. Relational Choice fails, at the types $(e\to t)$ and $e$. Let $U:=\lambda Xy\, .\,Xy\lor\neg\exists z\, .\,Xz$, a closed term, hence in the domain, and serial. A functional subrelation $S$ of $U$ would lie in the domain at the evaluation object, so it is symmetric and pinned down by a finite set $N$. Two facts about such an $S$ (Dorr, draft, Lemma 21): every $g\in G$ fixing $N$ pointwise satisfies $g^{[\sigma]}S=S$, and symmetry gives $\langle gA,gy,g\rangle\in S$ whenever $\langle A,y,1\rangle\in S$; together, $\langle gA,gy,1\rangle\in S$. Now let $A$ be the property of not belonging to $N$, at $W_0$. It is in the domain, being pinned down by that finite set and symmetric, and its extension is nonempty, so $S$ relates $A$ at the identity to some $y$ in its extension. The transposition of $y$ with another individual outside $N$ is a permutation of $W_0$, so lies in $G_{W_0}$, fixes $A$ and moves $y$ to some $gy\ne y$, so $S$ relates $A$ to $gy$ as well, and $S$ is not functional at the identity arrow. Argument of 23 September 2026, after Cian Dorr’s observation that a choice over the individuals cannot be finitely pinned down; the well-ordering of the individuals that he had in mind is refuted by the same two facts, but the direct route needs no derivation of a well-ordering from Relational Choice in C. Functional Choice also fails, including with relational outputs: replace a selected individual by its haecceity (the accompanying write-up gives an independent transposition proof of both failures). Plenitude still holds by C5 plus Actuality and Propositions 2.5 and 2.14, so this model separates it from Functional Choice even under C5, Rigid Comprehension and Boolean Completeness. This does not settle whether C5 plus Functional Choice implies Atomicity: the model fails the proposed premise.
