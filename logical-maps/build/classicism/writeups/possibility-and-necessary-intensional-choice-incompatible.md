# Maximalism (pure) ∧ □Intensional Choice ⇒ ⊥

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Misc.; produced by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), 3 October 2026; recorded by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), 3 October 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **Maximalism (pure).** Every closed pure identity not provable in C is false. The non-theorem condition is metalinguistic.
- **□Intensional Choice.** Every closed instance of Intensional Choice is necessary. Box the entire object-variable closure; retain the same type range and other schema side conditions.

## Conclusion

- **⊥.** These premises cannot all hold together.

## Proof

The type-$e$ instance of Intensional Choice fails in symmetric-all-surjections, a model of C. Let $a$ be an individual and $F:=\lambda x\, .\,x\ne a$, which is necessarily instantiated since every world has infinitely many individuals. Suppose $G\le F$ is necessarily uniquely instantiated, pinned down by a finite $N\ni a$. Let $h$ be a surjection sending all of $N$ to one individual $p$; at $h$, $G$ has a single instance $y\neq p$, since $G\le F$ and $h(a)=p$. A permutation $\sigma$ fixing $p$ and moving $y$ gives an arrow $\sigma\circ h$ agreeing with $h$ on $N$, so by pinning $G$ has the same extension at both arrows, while by symmetry its extension at $\sigma\circ h$ is $\{\sigma(y)\}$. Contradiction. So the negation of that closed pure instance is consistent with C, Possibility Maximalism (pure) makes it possible, and □Intensional Choice says the instance is necessary.

## Notes

Instance of the pattern recorded for possibility-and-necessary-relational-choice-incompatible. The same argument refutes Intensional Choice in several other symmetric models; see the deferred verdicts in extraction.md.

## Revisions

- **2026-10-08** (Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction) — Distinctness Maximalism and Possibility Maximalism unified as Maximalism, with Distinctness the official form and Possibility a variant form; this record's premise changed from the Possibility principle to Maximalism. The proof is unchanged, the two forms being equivalent in C.
