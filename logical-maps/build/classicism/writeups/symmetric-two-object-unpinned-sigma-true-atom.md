## Package

- **□Actuality.** Necessarily, there is a true proposition that entails every true proposition.
- **□Boolean Completeness.** Necessarily, every property of entities of a relational type has a greatest lower bound in that type.
- **Axiom of Infinity (type e).** There are not finitely many individuals. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **Axiom of Infinity (type t).** There are not finitely many propositions. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **Boolean Completeness.** Every property of entities of a relational type has a greatest lower bound in that type.
- **Distinctness-preserving collapse.** Every truth is necessary under the distinctness-preserving modality.
- **¬ Rigid Comprehension.** Every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a rigid one.
- **¬ □BF.** Necessarily, the Barcan Formula holds at every type. The predicate formulation closes the formula schema using lambda abstraction.
- **¬ No Pure Contingency.** Each closed sentence of the pure language, if true, is necessary. This is a sentence schema, not a quantifier over propositions.
- **¬ ND.** Distinct things of any type are necessarily distinct.
- **¬ Atomicity (type t).** Atomicity (type t) in the displayed closed propositional formulation.
- **¬ B for pure sentences.** The B instance for every closed sentence in the pure language.
- **¬ □Strong Actuality.** Necessarily, there is a true strong world proposition: a true proposition that necessarily entails every proposition or its negation.
- **¬ Relational Choice.** Every serial binary relation has a functional subrelation.
- **¬ Intensional Choice.** If a property is necessarily instantiated, then some property entailing it is necessarily uniquely instantiated.
- **¬ B for sentences of Σ.** The B instance for every closed sentence of the language of the fixed signature Sigma.
- **¬ No Contingency (signature Σ).** Each closed sentence of the language of the fixed signature Sigma, if true, is necessary. A sentence schema, standing to No Pure Contingency as Possibility Maximalism (signature Σ) stands to Possibility Maximalism (pure).
- **¬ Witnessed Possibility.** For pure-formulas P with free variables among a finite tuple x, and distinct matching nonlogical constants c, a witness to P entails that P at those constants is possible.
- **¬ Separated Structure.** For each typed nonlogical constant c and closed same-typed terms F,G not containing c, equality after application to c implies equality of F and G.
- **¬ Independence (signature Σ).** No constant of Sigma is a pure operation applied to other constants: for a closed pure term A and distinct constants c, d_1,…,d_n with n ≥ 0, c differs from A applied to the d’s. With n = 0, no constant denotes a pure entity.
- **¬ Maximalism (signature Σ).** The Maximalism schema for the fixed nonlogical signature Σ: every closed identity of its language not provable in C(Σ) is false.

## Definition

A symmetric ideally-full intensional action model over two objects, each a copy of the natural numbers. The arrows from the first object to itself are the permutations; the arrows from the first to the second and from the second to itself are all the functions; there are none back. Both symmetry groups are all the permutations. The first object carries the ideal of finite sets, the second the improper ideal, so at the second object every symmetric intension belongs to the domain. The evaluation point is the identity arrow on the first object.

Individuals, fixed for this record: the individuals at each object are the base the construction describes, and the arrows act on them as on the base.

Interpretation of Σ, fixed for this record: one designated relational constant $c$ of type $\tau=\bar\sigma t$ denotes $\lambda\bar x\, .\,a$, where $a$ is the unique true atom of the model, the actual-world proposition, the symmetry group; every other constant of Σ, of which there is at least one, is relational and denotes the top element of its type.

*A member of the group Symmetric ideally-full models, which supplies this definition with the record's settings, and the arguments marked as shared.*

## Arguments

### Holds □Actuality.

At both objects, and hence necessarily: at each, the orbit of the identity under the symmetry group is the smallest symmetric set of arrows containing it, and it is in the domain, at the first object because it is pinned down by the empty set and at the second because nothing is required there.

*By Cian Dorr, 2026-09-19.*

### Holds □Boolean Completeness.

At both, and hence necessarily: at the first by the draft's main theorem with the empty distinguished set, since an arrow to the first object is automatically a permutation and so separated, while for arrows to the second splicing is unconstrained; at the second trivially, since its domains are closed under arbitrary unions.

*By Cian Dorr, 2026-09-19.*

*Revised 2026-10-06 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Boolean Completeness at the first object is now the group argument boolean-completeness, by hull-conditions; this argument still gives its necessitation, through the second object.

### Fails Rigid Comprehension.

No rigid property of individuals is coextensive with the universal one. Weak persistence together with finite pinning forces any candidate to contain every pair whose arrow targets the second object, so its transport there is the top property. But the property of being in the range of one's arrow is symmetric and persistent, its extension at that world is everything, and the top property does not entail it, because the arrows out of the second object include non-surjections. So the rigidity criterion fails at that world.

*By Cian Dorr, 2026-09-19.*

### Fails □BF, No Pure Contingency.

The draft records that the type-e instance of BF is true at the base world and false at the second object, so BF is true while boxed BF is false; that is what the violation of boxed BF records, and it also refutes No Pure Contingency, since that instance is a closed pure sentence true at the base and false at an accessible world.

*By Cian Dorr, 2026-09-19.*

### Fails ND.

At type e because some arrow to the second object collapses two individuals.

*By Cian Dorr, 2026-09-19.*

### Fails Atomicity (type t).

The symmetry group of $W_0$ is an atom, but no atom lies inside the nonempty proposition of the arrows into $W_1$, which is pinned down by the empty set since targets are: a nonempty symmetric $p$ of such arrows pinned down by $N$ and containing $h$ contains every arrow into $W_1$ whose restriction to $N$ has the same fibres as $h$’s, the symmetry group of $W_1$ being all permutations, and those agreeing in that sense on $N\cup\{m\}$ form a smaller nonempty symmetric proposition.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-23.*

### Fails B for pure sentences.

The type-$e$ instance of BF is a closed pure sentence true at the base world and false at the second object, and no arrow leads back from the second object, so at that world the sentence is not even possible.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-25.*

### Fails □Strong Actuality.

Strong Actuality fails at the second object, which an arrow from the first reaches. There a true proposition contains the identity and, being symmetric, every permutation. Let $s$ be the successor map, an arrow from the second object to itself, and $k_0,k_1$ its retractions sending $n+1$ to $n$ and $0$ to $0$ and to $1$ respectively. Under $s$ the true proposition becomes one containing $k_0$ and $k_1$. The proposition that the arrow sends $0$ and $1$ to the same individual is closed under composition with permutations, so in the domain at the second object, where every symmetric intension is; it contains $k_0$ and not $k_1$. So no true proposition at the second object is a strong world. (Strong Actuality holds at the first object, by Actuality and the Distinctness-preserving collapse.)

*By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Fails Relational Choice.

At the types $(e\to t)$ and $e$. Let $U:=\lambda Xy\, .\,Xy\lor\neg\exists z\, .\,Xz$, a closed term, hence in the domain, and serial. A functional subrelation $S$ of $U$ would lie in the domain at the evaluation object, so it is symmetric and pinned down by a finite set $N$. Two facts about such an $S$ (Dorr, draft, Lemma 19(iv)): every $g\in G$ fixing $N$ pointwise satisfies $g^{[\sigma]}S=S$, and symmetry gives $\langle gA,gy,g\rangle\in S$ whenever $\langle A,y,1\rangle\in S$; together, $\langle gA,gy,1\rangle\in S$. Now let $A$ be the property the condition gives for $N$. Its extension is nonempty, so $S$ relates $A$ at the identity to some $y$ in its extension. The condition gives a member $g$ of the symmetry group that fixes $N$ pointwise, fixes $A$ and moves $y$ to some $gy\ne y$, so $S$ relates $A$ to $gy$ as well, and $S$ is not functional at the identity arrow. The well-ordering of the individuals that Cian Dorr had in mind is refuted by the same two facts, but the direct route needs no derivation of a well-ordering from Relational Choice in C.

*From the group *Symmetric ideally-full models*, shared argument `symmetric-ideally-full#relational-choice`. It requires that For each finite set $N$ of individuals at the evaluation object, some property $A$ in the domain has a nonempty extension there, and each individual $y$ in that extension is moved by a member of the symmetry group that fixes $N$ pointwise and fixes $A$. Here: $M=\emptyset$, and for $N$ the property of not belonging to $N$, at the first object, where the domain is symmetric and finitely pinned: the transposition of $y$ with another individual of the first object outside $N$ lies in its symmetry group. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), after Cian Dorr’s observation that a choice over the individuals cannot be finitely pinned down, 2026-09-23.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The members' seven copies, which differed in the property $A$ and the transposition, stated once; each member's $A$ and transposition moved to the condition transposable. The qualitative-contrast model's second argument (OpenAI Codex, 24 September) was dropped.

*Revised 2026-10-06 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The condition transposable no longer mentions the finite set $M$ or the pinning of $A$ by $N\cup M$: the argument uses only that $g$ fixes $N$, the set pinning down $S$, and that $A$ is in the domain. So $g$ is now said to fix $N$ pointwise. Proved in Lean.

### Holds Axiom of Infinity (type e).

There are infinitely many individuals, and identity at the identity arrow is literal, so no numeral counts them. The set of numerals at type $e$ is fixed by every arrow, hence symmetric and pinned down by the empty set, so finite cardinality is standard and no finite cardinality holds of the universal property.

*From the group *Symmetric ideally-full models*, shared argument `symmetric-ideally-full#axiom-of-infinity-e`. It requires that There are infinitely many individuals at the evaluation world. Here: The base is infinite. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-09-20.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The type-$e$ half of the members' argument, stated once; "the individuals are the natural numbers" became "there are infinitely many individuals", which also covers the qualitative links model. The type-$t$ half is axiom-of-infinity-t.

### Holds Axiom of Infinity (type t).

The propositions $C_{n,m}:=\{h : hn=hm\}$, that an arrow collapses $n$ and $m$, are symmetric, since relabelling the individuals of a world by a member of the symmetry group keeps identities among them, and each is pinned down by $\{n,m\}$; by the condition infinitely many of them are pairwise distinct, so there are infinitely many propositions. The set of numerals at type $t$ is fixed by every arrow, hence symmetric and pinned down by the empty set, so finite cardinality is standard and no finite cardinality holds of the universal property.

*From the group *Symmetric ideally-full models*, shared argument `symmetric-ideally-full#axiom-of-infinity-t`. It requires that There are infinitely many pairs of individuals such that, for any two of these pairs, some arrow collapses the one and not the other. Here: The pairs $\{n,m\}$ of individuals of the first object: a function into the second object that collapses $n$ with $m$ and nothing else is an arrow, all functions being arrows there. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-02.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Replaces the members' argument of 20 September (Claude Fable 5.1), which used the propositions $\{h : hn=n\}$ that an arrow fixes a given individual. Those are not symmetric when the symmetry group moves $n$: symmetry asks that $h\in p$ imply $g\circ h\in p$, and $(g\circ h)n=gn$.

### Holds Boolean Completeness.

At every relational type: a property $F$ of type-$\tau$ entities has a least upper bound, the union of the hulls of its instances. Let $F$ be pinned down by $N\supseteq M_0$. For each instance $u$ of $F$ at the identity, its hull is the closure of $u$ under the arrows that $N$ does not separate from the identity, transported along the arrows agreeing with the identity on $N$; it is symmetric, pinned down by $N$ (by (B1), which splices an arrow agreeing with $h'$ on the instance's pinning set with $h$ on $N$), and an upper bound of $u$. Every upper bound $z$ of all the instances, pinned down by $N'$, contains every hull: given a member of a hull, (B2) supplies a symmetry fixing $N$ and moving the instance's pinning set off $N'$, whose image is again an instance (by the orbit lemma, Lemma 35), lying under $z$; and $z$, pinned down by $N'$, cannot tell the moved instance's tuple from the original. The union of the hulls is pinned down by $N$ and symmetric, so it is in the domain, and it is the least upper bound.

*Source: Boolean Completeness does not imply Rigid Comprehension, Theorem 36, p. 18; Corollary 37, p. 19. From the group *Symmetric ideally-full models*, shared argument `symmetric-ideally-full#boolean-completeness`. It requires that There is a finite set $M_0$ of individuals at the evaluation object such that: (B1) for every finite $M\supseteq M_0$ and every arrow $h$ from the evaluation object to itself that $M$ does not separate (some arrow $k\notin G$ agrees with $h$ on $M$, or $h\in G$), every arrow $h'$ agreeing with $h$ on $M$, and finite $P,Q$ with $P\cap Q\subseteq M$, some arrow agrees with $h'$ on $P$ and with $h$ on $Q$; and (B2) for finite $N\supseteq M_0$ and finite $P,Q$, some member of the symmetry group fixes $N$ pointwise and moves every member of $P$ outside $N$ off $Q$. The arrows in (B1) go from the evaluation object to any one object, and $M$ separates $h$ when every arrow agreeing with $h$ on $M$ is a member of the symmetry group of the evaluation object. These are the hypotheses of Dorr's main theorem (draft, Definitions 28–30, Theorem 36). Here: With $M_0=\emptyset$ (the draft's argument for this model, Proposition 40): an arrow to the first object is a permutation and so separated by any set, while for arrows to the second, splicing is unconstrained, every function being an arrow; points are moved off a finite set by a permutation of the first object. By Cian Dorr, 2026-09-19.*

*Revised 2026-10-06 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The draft's main theorem, which the all-surjections and collapse-pair models each applied in an argument of their own, stated once; what each member does to meet its hypotheses is its reason for meeting hull-conditions. Proved in Lean (SymBase.lub_of_hull).

*Revised 2026-10-06 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* No longer requires one-object-action-model: as the draft notes (proof of Proposition 40), nothing in the theorem uses a single object, pinning, separation, amalgamability and hulls all quantifying over arrows with a fixed target; the condition hull-conditions now says so.

### Holds Distinctness-preserving collapse.

For a true $p$, $a\le p$, since $a$ entails every truth. Take $q:=a$ in the definition of $\Box_{\ne}p$: at a world in $a$, $p$ holds; at a world outside $a$, $\Diamond a$ fails. So every truth is $\Box_{\ne}$-necessary.

*General argument `arguments/dpc-isolated-actual-world`. It requires that The actual-world proposition $a$ is in the domain and entails every truth, and no world outside $a$ sees a world in $a$. Here: The actual-world proposition is the set of arrows from the first object to itself, all permutations, in the domain by the source argument for Actuality; no arrow from the second object returns to the first. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-23.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The finite-support, symmetric and full action models' copies (eight records) stated once for the topic; what varied, why no world outside the actual world sees back into it, is each record's reason for meeting actual-world-isolated.

### Fails Intensional Choice.

At type $e$. Let $F$ and $a$ be as the condition gives them, and suppose $G\le F$ is necessarily uniquely instantiated. $G$ is in the domain, so it is symmetric and pinned down by a finite set, which we may take to contain $a$; call it $N$. Let $h$ be the arrow the condition gives for $N$. Then $G_h=\{y\}$ for some $y$ in $F_h$. If $\sigma$ in the symmetry group fixes $p$, then $\sigma\circ h$ agrees with $h$ on $N$, so $G_{\sigma\circ h}=G_h$ by pinning, while symmetry gives $G_{\sigma\circ h}=\{\sigma y\}$. So no symmetry fixing $p$ moves $y$, and by the condition $y=p$. Each model's witness takes $F$ with $p$ outside its extension at $h$, a contradiction. $\Box$Intensional Choice fails with it, by T.

*General argument `arguments/intensional-choice-collapse`. It requires that A group $G$ acts on the individuals at the evaluation object, and every element of a relational domain there is symmetric, meaning that $\langle\bar x,h\rangle\in D$ implies $\langle g\cdot\bar x,g\circ h\rangle\in D$ whenever $g\in G$ and $g\circ h$ is an arrow, and is pinned down by a finite set of individuals, its extension at an arrow depending only on the arrow's values there. Here: The relational domains hold exactly the symmetric intensions pinned down by a finite set (Dorr, draft, Definitions 15–18). It requires that The individuals at the evaluation object are those the construction acts on, and the arrows act on them as the construction says. Here: The individuals are the base, acted on as the construction says. It requires that There are an individual $a$ and a necessarily instantiated property $F$ in the domain such that, for every finite set $N$ of individuals at the evaluation object, some arrow $h$ sends $N\cup\{a\}$ to a single individual $p$, and every individual $y\ne p$ in $F$'s extension at $h$ is moved by a member $\sigma$ of the symmetry group that fixes $p$, with $\sigma\circ h$ again an arrow. Here: Take $F:=\lambda x\, .\,x\ne a$, so $p\notin F_h$. $h$ is a function from the first object to the second that is constant on $N\cup\{a\}$; the symmetry group of the second object is all permutations. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), 2026-10-03.*

*Revised 2026-10-03 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Recorded from the collapse lemma deferred in extraction.md on 3 October until the model records' new format landed (not yet checked by a human). It needs the individuals the construction gives. Not covered: the qualitative-links model, whose arrows preserve a ternary relation and so cannot send everything to one point, and the qualitative-contrast model, whose arrows are bijections and where Intensional Choice holds.

*Revised 2026-10-04 by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Moved from the group symmetric-ideally-full to the topic, so that the symmetry-constrained full models use it too: in those models every intension is pinned down by the finite set of all individuals, and the collapses are the constant maps. The group's `when: individuals: base` is now the condition construction-individuals, met by that parameter value.

### Fails B for sentences of Σ.

B for sentences of Σ fails: the Σ-sentence $\forall\bar x\, .\,c\bar x$ denotes $a$, which is true, and under an arrow from which no world in $a$ is accessible $\Diamond a$ is false, so $\Box\Diamond a$ fails.

*General argument `arguments/sigma-true-atom-b`. It requires that Σ has a designated relational constant $c$ of type $\tau=\bar\sigma t$ denoting $\lambda\bar x\, .\,a$, where $a$ is the actual-world proposition, the unique true atom; every other constant, of which there is at least one, is relational and denotes the top element of its type. Here: This is the interpretation. It requires that The actual-world proposition $a$, the strongest truth, is in the domain; it is necessary at no world, and some arrow does not fix it. Here: The actual-world proposition, the arrows from the first object to itself, is in the domain; at every world an arrow into the second object leads outside it, and such an arrow carries it to the empty set. It requires that Some world sees no world at which the actual-world proposition is true. Here: An arrow into the second object: no arrow returns from there to the first. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr’s request, 2026-09-22.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The B clause of the records' Σ-as-true-atom argument, stated once for the topic.

### Fails No Contingency (signature Σ), Witnessed Possibility, Separated Structure, Independence (signature Σ), Maximalism (signature Σ).

No Contingency (signature Σ) fails, since the Σ-sentence $\forall\bar x\, .\,c\bar x$ denotes $a$, true and contingent; Witnessed Possibility fails for the pure formula $x=\top_\tau$, witnessed by $\top_\tau$, since $\Diamond(c=\top_\tau)$ is $\Diamond\Box a$ and $a$ is necessary at no world; Separated Structure fails with it, being equivalent to Possibly Witnessed Possibility; Independence (signature Σ) and Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ) fail through the other relational constants: such a constant $c'$ of type $\tau'$ denotes what the closed pure term $\top_{\tau'}$ denotes, and $c'=\top_{\tau'}$ is a true identity that C(Σ) does not prove. The designated constant refutes neither: closed pure terms denote entities fixed by every arrow (Classicism, §3.5, p. 58), whereas some arrow does not fix $a$, so no closed pure term denotes $\lambda\bar x\, .\,a$.

*General argument `arguments/sigma-true-atom`. It requires that Σ has a designated relational constant $c$ of type $\tau=\bar\sigma t$ denoting $\lambda\bar x\, .\,a$, where $a$ is the actual-world proposition, the unique true atom; every other constant, of which there is at least one, is relational and denotes the top element of its type. Here: This is the interpretation. It requires that The actual-world proposition $a$, the strongest truth, is in the domain; it is necessary at no world, and some arrow does not fix it. Here: The actual-world proposition, the arrows from the first object to itself, is in the domain; at every world an arrow into the second object leads outside it, and such an arrow carries it to the empty set. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr’s request, 2026-09-22.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The verbatim copies in ten records (finite-support, symmetric and full action models) stated once for the topic. Its B clause is now sigma-true-atom-b, which needs an arrow from which the actual world is out of reach. "$a$ is fixed by no arrow but the identity" became "some arrow does not fix $a$": in a symmetric model the actual-world proposition is the symmetry group, which its members fix, and the conclusion needs only the weaker claim.


## Notes

The point of the model is that boxed Boolean Completeness and boxed Actuality, and so Weak Rigid Comprehension, do not yield Rigid Comprehension. The gap is exactly the leading box of the inextensibility conjunct. The status of the unboxed BF schema at the base world is left unknown here: the draft's working comments report that higher-type instances fail there, which would make the schema fail, but its text does not. The source is a work in progress. Everything that implies these fails with them.

## History

The record's revision log before it was written as arguments.

- **2026-09-25** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added the failure of B for pure sentences; see the notes. Now violates: B for pure sentences.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Recorded the Distinctness-preserving collapse; see the notes. Now satisfies: Distinctness-preserving collapse.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Recorded the failure of Relational Choice, at types (e→t) and e: a functional subrelation of the serial relation pairing each property with its members would be symmetric and finitely pinned, and a symmetry fixing its pinning set would carry its choice for the property of lying outside that set to a second choice. Cian Dorr’s observation that a choice cannot be finitely pinned; argument in the notes. Now violates: Relational Choice.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Recorded the failure of Atomicity (type t), and with it of the Strong Leibniz Biconditionals; see the notes. Now violates: Atomicity (type t).
- **2026-09-22** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Fixed an interpretation of Σ (relational constants as top, individual constants as one fixed individual) and recorded the signature schemata it refutes, at Cian Dorr’s request. Now violates: Witnessed Possibility, Separated Structure, Independence (signature Σ), Maximalism (signature Σ).
- **2026-09-20** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added both Axioms of Infinity at Cian Dorr's direction. The individuals are the natural numbers and identity at the identity arrow is literal, so no numeral counts them. The propositions that a given individual is fixed by the arrow, one for each individual, are pairwise distinct, symmetric and pinned by that individual, so there are infinitely many propositions. The set of numerals at each type is invariant under every arrow, hence symmetric and pinned by the empty set, so finite cardinality is standard and no finite cardinality holds of the universal property at either type. Now satisfies: Axiom of Infinity (type e), Axiom of Infinity (type t).
