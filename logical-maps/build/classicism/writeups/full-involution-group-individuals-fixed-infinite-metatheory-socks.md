## Package

- **Gallin Extensional Comprehension.** Every relation is coextensive with one that is persistent and has a persistent pointwise negation. This is the source’s comparison with Gallin’s different rigidity convention.
- **Axiom of Infinity (type e).** There are not finitely many individuals. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **□Atomicity.** Necessarily, every non-bottom entity of each relational type has an atom below it.
- **□BF.** Necessarily, the Barcan Formula holds at every type. The predicate formulation closes the formula schema using lambda abstraction.
- **□Rigid Comprehension.** Necessarily, every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a rigid one.
- **Infinity Schema (type e).** There are arbitrarily many pairwise distinct entities of this fixed type; one sentence for each positive integer n.
- **□Intensional Choice.** Every closed instance of Intensional Choice is necessary. Box the entire object-variable closure; retain the same type range and other schema side conditions.
- **□ND.** Necessarily, distinct things of any type are necessarily distinct.
- **No Pure Contingency.** Each closed sentence of the pure language, if true, is necessary. This is a sentence schema, not a quantifier over propositions.
- **Rigid Power.** If a relation is rigid, so is the property of being a rigid relation that entails it.
- **□Rigid Power.** Every closed instance of Rigid Power is necessary. Box the entire object-variable closure; retain the same type range and other schema side conditions.
- **No Contingency (signature Σ).** Each closed sentence of the language of the fixed signature Sigma, if true, is necessary. A sentence schema, standing to No Pure Contingency as Possibility Maximalism (signature Σ) stands to Possibility Maximalism (pure).
- **B for sentences of Σ.** The B instance for every closed sentence of the language of the fixed signature Sigma.
- **¬ Distinctness-preserving collapse.** Every truth is necessary under the distinctness-preserving modality.
- **¬ Possible Infinity (type t).** Possibly there are not finitely many propositions: the Axiom of Infinity at this type, under a diamond.
- **¬ Infinity Schema (type t).** There are arbitrarily many pairwise distinct entities of this fixed type; one sentence for each positive integer n.
- **¬ Axiom of Infinity (type t).** There are not finitely many propositions. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **¬ Fregean Axiom.** Materially equivalent propositions are identical.
- **¬ Witnessed Possibility.** For pure-formulas P with free variables among a finite tuple x, and distinct matching nonlogical constants c, a witness to P entails that P at those constants is possible.
- **¬ Separated Structure.** For each typed nonlogical constant c and closed same-typed terms F,G not containing c, equality after application to c implies equality of F and G.
- **¬ Independence (signature Σ).** No constant of Sigma is a pure operation applied to other constants: for a closed pure term A and distinct constants c, d_1,…,d_n with n ≥ 0, c differs from A applied to the d’s. With n = 0, no constant denotes a pure entity.
- **¬ Maximalism (signature Σ).** The Maximalism schema for the fixed nonlogical signature Σ: every closed identity of its language not provable in C(Σ) is false.
- **¬ Relational Choice.** Every serial binary relation has a functional subrelation.

## Definition

The full action model on the two-element group $\{1,k\}$ with $k^2=1$: the construction of Classicism p. 59 (record full-idempotent-monoid) with the two-arrow multiplication changed to $k^2=1$. Evaluate at the sole object. The propositions at the evaluation object are the subsets of the two arrows out of it, four in all, and every intension of a full model is present.

Individuals, fixed for this record: at every object the individuals are the members of an infinite set $D$, the same at every object, and every arrow acts on them as the identity.

Interpretation of Σ, fixed for this record: every constant of Σ is relational, and each denotes the top element of its type.

Metatheory, fixed for this record: the construction is carried out in ZF together with a countable family $(P_n)_{n\in\omega}$ of pairwise disjoint two-element sets that has no choice function (Russell's socks), which is consistent with ZF (Fraenkel's second permutation model, transferred to ZF by the Jech–Sochor theorem). Every infinite set the construction leaves unspecified (the individuals, the worlds, a carrier) is their union. The verdicts of this record are relative-consistency claims of the same standing as those of a record with choice.

*A member of the group Full action models, which supplies this definition with the record's settings, and the arguments marked as shared.*

## Arguments

### Holds Gallin Extensional Comprehension.

Given $X$ with extension $E$ at the evaluation object, let $Y$ hold at an arrow $g$ of a tuple $\bar b$ at $g$'s target iff $r_g\cdot\bar b\in E$; it is in the domain since the model is full. It is coextensive with $X$, since $r_1=1$. And whether it holds is unchanged along every arrow: at $x\circ g$, of $x\cdot\bar b$, it holds iff $r_{x\circ g}\cdot x\cdot\bar b=r_g\cdot\bar b\in E$. So $Y$ and its negation are persistent. (The retract's own argument of 25 September, generalized.)

*General argument `arguments/coherent-retractions`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that Every arrow $g$ out of the evaluation object has a retraction $r_g$, chosen so that $r_{x\circ g}\circ x=r_g$ for every arrow $x$ after $g$. Here: $r_g:=g^{-1}$: then $r_{x\circ g}\circ x=g^{-1}\circ x^{-1}\circ x=g^{-1}$. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Fails Distinctness-preserving collapse.

Let $p:=\{1\}$, in the domain since the model is full, and true. Any witness $q$ for $\Box_{\ne}p$ is true, so contains the identity; under an arrow $i\ne 1$ with a retraction $r$, the arrow $r\circ i=1$ makes $\Diamond q$ true, while $p$ is false. So no true $q$ has $\Box(\Diamond q\to p)$. (The surjection monoid's own argument of 23 September, stated once.)

*General argument `arguments/dpc-returning-arrow`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that Some arrow out of the evaluation object other than its identity has a retraction: an arrow back after which it composes to the identity. Here: $k$, its own inverse. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Fails Possible Infinity (type t).

At a world with $n$ propositions, the numeral $\operatorname{Suc}^n_t\mathbf{0}_t$, a finite cardinality, holds of the universal property of propositions, so the Axiom of Infinity at type $t$ fails there. It fails at every world, so Possible Infinity at type $t$ fails.

*General argument `arguments/finitely-many-propositions-everywhere`. It requires that There are finitely many propositions at every object reachable from the evaluation point. Here: There is one object, with four propositions, the sets of the two arrows. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Fails Infinity Schema (type t), Axiom of Infinity (type t).

The propositions at the evaluation world are finitely many, and every intension of a full model is present, so the numerals are the finite cardinalities and one of them holds of the universal property of propositions: the Axiom of Infinity at type t fails, as does an instance of the schema.

*General argument `arguments/finitely-many-propositions`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that There are finitely many propositions at the evaluation world. Here: The propositions at the evaluation object are the subsets of the two arrows out of it, four in all. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-09-20.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The copies in three full action models (each with four propositions) stated once for the topic; each record's count is its reason for meeting finitely-many-propositions.

*Revised 2026-10-06 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The Axiom of Infinity's failure, which the text states, recorded as a verdict of its own, so that it is certified without the result that the Axiom implies the schema.

### Holds Axiom of Infinity (type e).

The individuals at the evaluation object are an infinite set and identity there is literal. The numerals at type $e$ are intensions of a full model, so they are the finite cardinalities, and none of them holds of the universal property: no finite cardinality holds of an infinite set. This is the argument the full surjection-monoid record gave for its own infinite individuals.

*General argument `arguments/fixed-infinite-individuals`. It requires that At every object the individuals are the same infinite set, and every arrow acts on them as the identity. Here: This is the choice of individuals. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-03.*

### Holds □Atomicity.

Entailment is inclusion of intensions. Below a relation $Y\ne\bot_\tau$ lies the relation whose intension is the singleton of one of $Y$'s tuples, which is in the domain since the model is full, and is an atom: its only proper part is $\bot_\tau$. Every object being full, the same holds at every arrow, so Atomicity is necessary. The source notes that full models are atomic (p. 61); stated once for the topic, in place of the full models' own arguments.

*Source: Classicism, p. 61. General argument `arguments/full-atomicity`. It requires that The model is a full action model: an action model (Classicism, Appendix D) that is full at every object. Here: An action model, full at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59; Appendix D). By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Holds □BF.

BF holds at an object whose arrows out all act surjectively at every type (Proposition 3.24(ii)). In a full model the transport of intensions along an epimorphism $k$ is onto: an intension $Y$ at its target is the transport of $\{\langle\bar a,k\circ m\rangle : \langle\bar a,m\rangle\in Y\}$, since $k\circ m=k\circ m'$ only if $m=m'$; and on the individuals the arrows are onto by the condition. So BF holds at every object reachable from the evaluation point, and BF is necessary.

*Source: Classicism, §3.5, Proposition 3.24(ii). General argument `arguments/full-epic-barcan`. It requires that The model is a full action model: an action model (Classicism, Appendix D) that is full at every object. Here: An action model, full at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59; Appendix D). It requires that Every arrow out of every object reachable from the evaluation point is an epimorphism (arrows after it that agree after it are equal) and acts surjectively on the individuals. Here: Every arrow is invertible; and on the individuals every arrow is the identity. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Holds □Rigid Comprehension.

Given $X$ of type $\tau$ at an object $W$, let $Y$ be the relation whose extension at an arrow $i$ out of $W$ is $X$'s extension at $W$ transported along $i$, which is in the domain since the model is full. It is coextensive with $X$. It is persistent, since its extension at $i\circ j$ is its extension at $i$ transported along $j$. And it is inextensible: if $\Box X'$ holds at $i$ of everything $Y$ holds of there, then at $i\circ j$ everything $Y$ holds of is the transport along $j$ of something $Y$ holds of at $i$, of which $X'$ then holds. Every object being full, the same holds at every arrow, so Rigid Comprehension is necessary. The source notes that full models satisfy it (p. 61); stated once for the topic, in place of the full models' own arguments.

*Source: Classicism, p. 61. General argument `arguments/full-rigid-comprehension`. It requires that The model is a full action model: an action model (Classicism, Appendix D) that is full at every object. Here: An action model, full at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59; Appendix D). By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Holds Axiom of Infinity (type e), Infinity Schema (type e).

The Infinity schema holds, there being $n$ distinct individuals for every $n$. For the Axiom: by extensional fullness the domain has a property of cardinalities true of $Z$ exactly when every property $Z$ holds of has a finite extension. It holds of $\mathbf{0}_e$, which holds only of empty properties, and passes from $Y$ to $\operatorname{Suc}_e Y$, which holds of $F$ only if $Y$ holds of $F$ less one of its instances. So every finite cardinality has it, and none holds of the universal property, whose extension is infinite.

*General argument `arguments/infinitely-many-individuals`. It requires that The model is extensionally full at every object: every set of tuples from the domains at an object is the extension, at the identity arrow, of an element of the domain of the matching relational type there. Here: A full model contains every intension, so in particular one with any given extension at the identity. It requires that There are infinitely many individuals at the evaluation world. Here: $D$ is infinite. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Holds □Intensional Choice.

At an object reachable from the evaluation point the propositions are all the sets of arrows out of it, so there are finitely many arrows out. A necessarily instantiated $F$ there assigns to each of them a nonempty set, and a finite family of nonempty sets has a choice function without the axiom of choice; the intension holding at each arrow of the chosen member alone is in the domain, the model being full, lies below $F$ and is necessarily uniquely instantiated. So Intensional Choice holds at every reachable object, at every type. (The finite-germ argument of the 3 October 2026 analysis, for full models; with choice the well-ordering argument gives the same.)

*General argument `arguments/intensional-choice-finitely-many-arrows`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that There are finitely many propositions at every object reachable from the evaluation point. Here: There is one object, with four propositions, the sets of the two arrows. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-08.*

### Holds □ND, □BF.

Every arrow's action is a bijection at every type, so ND and BF hold at every object reachable from the evaluation point (Proposition 3.24(i) and (ii)), and are necessary.

*Source: Classicism, §3.5, Proposition 3.24. General argument `arguments/invertible-arrows`. It requires that Every arrow out of every object reachable from the evaluation point is invertible. Here: The arrows form a group. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Holds No Pure Contingency.

Closed pure terms denote entities fixed by every arrow (§3.5, p. 58). With a single object, a proposition fixed by every arrow contains every arrow if it contains the identity and no arrow otherwise, so a true closed pure sentence is necessary: the source's one-object No Pure Contingency observation (p. 79), applied to each closed instance.

*Source: Classicism, §3.5, p. 58; p. 79. General argument `arguments/no-pure-contingency-one-object`. It requires that The model is an action model (Classicism, Appendix D), or an intensional action model in the sense of Dorr's draft (Boolean Completeness does not imply Rigid Comprehension), with a single object. Here: It has one object. By Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr, 2026-09-17.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Moved from the group finite-support-one-object to the topic, for every one-object action model; the reason the source's observation holds is spelled out in place of "Boxed positive flags use the source’s explicit one-object No Pure Contingency observation, applied separately to each closed instance."

### Fails Fregean Axiom.

The propositions $\top$ and $\{1\}$ are in the domain, the model being full; they are both true at the evaluation point and differ at the other arrow, so the Fregean Axiom fails.

*Source: Classicism, p. 61. General argument `arguments/nonidentity-arrow`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that Some arrow out of the evaluation object is not its identity. Here: The involution $k$. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Holds Rigid Power, □Rigid Power.

Write $X_0(E)$ for the intension $k\mapsto k\cdot E$. The extension at an arrow $h$ of the power property $\lambda X\, .\,\operatorname{Rigid}(X)\land X\le F$ is the set of rigid $X$ with $X\le h\cdot F$, the bound variable ranging over the domain untransported and the parameter transported. By the condition the rigid relations are the $X_0(E)$, and $X_0(T)\le X_0(S)$ iff $T\subseteq S$; so for rigid $F=X_0(S)$ the power property has extension $\{X_0(T'):T'\subseteq k\cdot S\}$ at $k$, while transporting its extension at the identity along $k$ gives $\{X_0(k\cdot T):T\subseteq S\}$. These coincide, since every $T'\subseteq k\cdot S$ is $k\cdot T$ for $T:=\{s\in S:k\cdot s\in T'\}$. So the power property is itself $X_0$ of its extension, hence rigid, and the same at every reachable object gives the boxed form.

*General argument `arguments/rigid-power-tight`. It requires that At every object reachable from the evaluation point, the rigid relations of each relational type are exactly the intensions $k\mapsto k\cdot E$, the disjunctions of the haecceities of the members of $E$, for $E$ any set of tuples from the domains there; in particular every such intension is in the domain. Here: Every intension is present, so for any set $E$ the intension $k\mapsto k\cdot E$ is in the domain, and a relation is weakly inextensible at a world iff it lies below that intension over its extension there, since that is the smallest intension satisfying the hypothesis; with persistence, a rigid relation equals it (the argument deferred in extraction.md, 3 October 2026). By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), 3 October 2026 (full action models); extended by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 4 October 2026, at Cian Dorr's direction.*

*Revised 2026-10-04 by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The argument deferred in extraction.md on 3 October for the full action models, where every intension is present, stated under the condition it actually uses, which the symmetry-constrained full models also meet.

### Fails Witnessed Possibility, Separated Structure, Independence (signature Σ), Maximalism (signature Σ).

Let $c\in\Sigma$ have relational type $\tau$, so $c=\top_\tau$ necessarily. Witnessed Possibility fails for the pure formula $x\ne\top_\tau$, witnessed by $\bot_\tau$ but impossible of $c$; Separated Structure fails since $\lambda x\, .\,x$ and $\lambda x\, .\,\top_\tau$ agree on $c$ and differ; Independence (signature Σ) fails since $c$ denotes what the closed pure term $\top_\tau$ denotes; Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ) fails since $c=\top_\tau$ is a true identity that C(Σ) does not prove.

*General argument `arguments/sigma-top`. It requires that Every constant of Σ is relational, and each denotes the top element of its type. Here: This is the interpretation. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr’s request, 2026-09-22.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Moved from the group finite-support-one-object to the topic; it uses nothing about the model.

### Fails Relational Choice.

At type $e$. The individuals, which every arrow fixes, are an unspecified infinite set, so here the union $D=\bigcup_n P_n$. Let $U$ relate each member of $P_n$ to the members of $P_{n+1}$; it is in the domain, the model being full, and serial. A functional subrelation would send each sock to a sock of the next pair, and iterated from one member of $P_0$ it would choose a sock from every pair.

*General argument `arguments/socks-relational-choice`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that At every object the individuals are the same infinite set, and every arrow acts on them as the identity. Here: This is the choice of individuals. It requires that The construction is carried out in ZF with a countable family $(P_n)_{n\in\omega}$ of pairwise disjoint two-element sets that has no choice function, and every infinite set the construction leaves unspecified is their union. Here: This is the hypothesis. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-08.*

### Holds No Contingency (signature Σ), B for sentences of Σ.

Each constant of Σ denotes what the closed pure term $\top_\tau$ of its type denotes, so a closed sentence of the language of Σ denotes what the pure sentence with $\top_\tau$ in place of each constant denotes; if true it is necessary by No Pure Contingency, which holds here. So No Contingency (signature Σ) holds, and B for sentences of Σ with it: a true Σ-sentence is necessary, hence necessarily possible.

*General argument `arguments/sigma-top-npc`. It requires that Every constant of Σ is relational, and each denotes the top element of its type. Here: This is the interpretation. By Cian Dorr (observation); recorded by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), 2026-10-02.*

*Revised 2026-10-03 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The argument sigma-single-top, for Σ a single constant of type $t$ denoting $\top$, stated for every interpretation of Σ by top elements, now that such interpretations have no individual constants. It replaces that argument and nc-sigma-homogeneous, which reached the same verdicts through an individual constant when the model's automorphisms carry every individual to every other. With an individual constant and no such automorphisms the verdicts were unknown in 19 models, and nowhere did the individual constants settle a verdict differently.


## Notes

The cited construction is a model of the map’s relational-type framework. The description identifies its evaluation point; construction and verification are given at the PDF locations in References. Everything that implies these fails with them.

## History

The record's revision log before it was written as arguments.

- **2026-09-25** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added Transversal Choice, by the argument recorded for Relational Choice: a full model contains every intension, in particular one whose extension at the evaluation point is a transversal, chosen in the metatheory, of the extension there of an equivalence relation; the equivalence and transversal conditions are unboxed. Recorded on a question of Zachary Goodsell, after an observation of Christopher Sun. Now satisfies: Transversal Choice.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Re-fixed the interpretation of Σ so as to settle No Contingency (signature Σ) and B for sentences of Σ, at Cian Dorr’s request; see the notes. Now violates: No Contingency (signature Σ).
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Corrected the reason given for the failures of Independence (signature Σ) and Distinctness (signature Σ): the true atom is denoted by no closed pure term, since such terms denote entities fixed by every arrow; the failures come from the other relational constants, which denote top. No verdict changes.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Corrected the justification of □Strong Leibniz Biconditionals (type t): the 22 September argument tacitly used that the monoid is right-cancellative, which holds here; no verdict changes.
- **2026-09-22** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Fixed an interpretation of Σ (relational constants as top, individual constants as one fixed individual) and recorded the signature schemata it refutes, at Cian Dorr’s request. Now violates: Witnessed Possibility, Separated Structure, Independence (signature Σ), Maximalism (signature Σ).
- **2026-09-22** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added □Strong Leibniz Biconditionals (type t): every singleton of an arrow is a strong world in a propositionally full one-object model; see the notes. Now satisfies: □Strong Leibniz Biconditionals (type t).
- **2026-09-22** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Boxed the Relational Choice claim; see the notes. Now satisfies: □Relational Choice.
- **2026-09-20** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added Relational Choice at Cian Dorr's direction. With choice in the metatheory a serial relation has a functional subrelation, and a full model contains every intension, so that subrelation is in the domain; see Classicism, p. 61, on the principles common to full models. The propositions at the evaluation object are the subsets of the two arrows out of it, four in all, and every intension of a full model is present, so the numerals are the finite cardinalities and the fourth holds of the universal property of propositions: the Axiom of Infinity at type t fails, as does the fifth instance of the schema. Now satisfies: Relational Choice. Now violates: Axiom of Infinity (type t), Infinity Schema (type t).
- **2026-09-17** (OpenAI Codex (GPT-6)) — Adopted the source’s relational type system at the user’s request. The cited construction now directly supplies the recorded model; the former type-extension obligation is removed. Now satisfies: □Rigid Comprehension, □Atomicity, □Actuality, □ND, No Pure Contingency. Now violates: Fregean Axiom.
