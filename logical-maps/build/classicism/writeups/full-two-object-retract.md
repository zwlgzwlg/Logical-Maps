<p class='cert'>Model — Source: Classicism (2024); produced by Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr; recorded by OpenAI Codex (GPT-6), 17 September 2026.</p>

## Package

- **□Rigid Comprehension.** Necessarily, every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a rigid one.
- **□Atomicity.** Necessarily, every non-bottom entity of each relational type has an atom below it.
- **□Actuality.** Necessarily, there is a true proposition that entails every true proposition.
- **ND (type t).** ND (type t) in the displayed closed propositional formulation.
- **B for pure sentences.** The B instance for every closed sentence in the pure language.
- **Relational Choice.** Every serial binary relation has a functional subrelation.
- **□Relational Choice.** Necessarily, every serial binary relation has a functional subrelation.
- **Transversal Choice.** Every equivalence relation, at any type including e, has a transversal, that is, a property with exactly one instance in each of its cells.
- **Gallin Extensional Comprehension.** Every relation is coextensive with one that is persistent and has a persistent pointwise negation. This is the source’s comparison with Gallin’s different rigidity convention.
- **¬ □ND (type t).** Necessarily, ND (type t) holds, in the displayed closed propositional formulation.
- **¬ No Pure Contingency.** Each closed sentence of the pure language, if true, is necessary. This is a sentence schema, not a quantifier over propositions.
- **¬ Witnessed Possibility.** For pure-formulas P with free variables among a finite tuple x, and distinct matching nonlogical constants c, a witness to P entails that P at those constants is possible.
- **¬ Separated Structure.** For each typed nonlogical constant c and closed same-typed terms F,G not containing c, equality after application to c implies equality of F and G.
- **¬ Independence (signature Σ).** No constant of Sigma is a pure operation applied to other constants: for a closed pure term A and distinct constants c, d_1,…,d_n with n ≥ 0, c differs from A applied to the d’s. With n = 0, no constant denotes a pure entity.
- **¬ Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ).** The Distinctness Maximalism schema for the fixed nonlogical signature Sigma.
- **¬ Strong Leibniz Biconditionals (type t).** The type-t instance of the Strong Leibniz Biconditionals: every possible proposition is entailed by a strong world proposition, one that is possible and necessarily entails every proposition or its negation.
- **¬ Distinctness-preserving collapse.** Every truth is necessary under the distinctness-preserving modality.
- **¬ Infinity Schema (type t).** There are arbitrarily many pairwise distinct entities of this fixed type; one sentence for each positive integer n.
- **¬ Possible Infinity (type t).** Possibly there are not finitely many propositions: the Axiom of Infinity at this type, under a diamond.

## Construction

Use the source’s category with h:W0→W1, j:W1→W0 and k:W1→W1, evaluated at W0. ND at t holds there and fails at W1. Only the type-t ND assertion is recorded.

## Notes

The cited construction is a model of the map’s relational-type framework. The description identifies its evaluation point; construction and verification are given at the PDF locations in References. Interpretation of Σ, fixed for this record: each relational constant denotes the top element of its type and each individual constant denotes one fixed individual. Under it the signature schemata fail. Let $c\in\Sigma$ have relational type $\tau$, so $c=\top_\tau$ necessarily. Witnessed Possibility fails for the pure formula $x\ne\top_\tau$, witnessed by $\bot_\tau$ but impossible of $c$; Separated Structure fails since $\lambda x\, .\,x$ and $\lambda x\, .\,\top_\tau$ agree on $c$ and differ; Independence (signature Σ) fails since $c$ denotes what the closed pure term $\top_\tau$ denotes; Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ) fails since $c=\top_\tau$ is a true identity that C(Σ) does not prove. Everything that implies these fails with them. The type-t Strong Leibniz Biconditionals fail at $W_0$: the possible proposition $\{h\}$ has only itself as a candidate strong world below it, but under $h$ it becomes $\{x : x\circ h=h\}=\{\mathrm{id}_{W_1},k\}$, which the proposition $\{\mathrm{id}_{W_1}\}$ of $W_1$’s full domain separates, so $\{h\}$ does not necessarily settle every proposition. Since Atomicity holds in this full model, this shows that Atomicity (type t) alone does not yield the type-t Strong Leibniz Biconditionals; BF (type t) fails here, $h$ acting non-surjectively from a four-element to an eight-element domain. □Relational Choice holds: the truncation of a full action model at any arrow is again a full action model, its domains at the reachable objects being unchanged, and Relational Choice holds in every full model given choice in the metatheory (Classicism, p. 61). Distinctness-preserving collapse fails at $W_0$: let $p:=\{\mathrm{id}_{W_0}\}$, true. A witness $q$ contains $\mathrm{id}_{W_0}$, and $j\circ h=\mathrm{id}_{W_0}$, so $\Diamond q$ holds under $h$ while $p$ does not. Gallin Extensional Comprehension holds at $W_0$. Since $j\circ h=1_{W_0}$, every arrow out of $W_0$ acts injectively at every type (a left inverse exists), and the equivalence relation on pairs (arrow $g$ out of $W_0$, tuple at its target) generated by $(g,\bar b)\sim(x\circ g,x\cdot\bar b)$ has as its classes the sets $\{(1_{W_0},\bar a)\}\cup\{(h,\bar b) : j\cdot\bar b=\bar a\}$, one for each tuple $\bar a$ at $W_0$, using $k\circ h=h$ and $j\circ k=j$. Given $X$ with extension $E$ at $W_0$, let $Y$ hold at $(g,\bar b)$ iff that pair lies in the class of some $(1_{W_0},\bar a)$ with $\bar a\in E$; $Y$ is a natural intension, so in the full model, it is coextensive with $X$ at $W_0$, and both $Y$ and its negation take only the values $\top$ and $\bot$, so both are persistent. The boxed form fails, as recorded, since ND fails at $W_1$. The Infinity Schema at type $t$ fails: $W_0$ has exactly four propositions with literal identity, so there are no five pairwise distinct ones; Possible Infinity (type $t$) fails as well, since $W_1$ has eight.

## Revisions

- **2026-09-25** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added Transversal Choice, by the argument recorded for Relational Choice: a full model contains every intension, in particular one whose extension at the evaluation point is a transversal, chosen in the metatheory, of the extension there of an equivalence relation; the equivalence and transversal conditions are unboxed. Recorded on a question of Zachary Goodsell, after an observation of Christopher Sun. Now satisfies: Transversal Choice.
- **2026-09-25** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added Gallin Extensional Comprehension at W0, and the failure of the Infinity Schema and of Possible Infinity at type t; see the notes. Now satisfies: Gallin Extensional Comprehension. Now violates: Infinity Schema (type t), Possible Infinity (type t).
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Recorded the Distinctness-preserving collapse; see the notes. Now violates: Distinctness-preserving collapse.
- **2026-09-22** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Fixed an interpretation of Σ (relational constants as top, individual constants as one fixed individual) and recorded the signature schemata it refutes, at Cian Dorr’s request. Now violates: Witnessed Possibility, Separated Structure, Independence (signature Σ), Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ).
- **2026-09-22** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added the failure of Strong Leibniz Biconditionals (type t) at W0; see the notes. Now violates: Strong Leibniz Biconditionals (type t).
- **2026-09-22** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Boxed the Relational Choice claim; see the notes. Now satisfies: □Relational Choice.
- **2026-09-20** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added Relational Choice at Cian Dorr's direction. With choice in the metatheory a serial relation has a functional subrelation, and a full model contains every intension, so that subrelation is in the domain; see Classicism, p. 61, on the principles common to full models. Now satisfies: Relational Choice.
- **2026-09-17** (OpenAI Codex (GPT-6)) — Adopted the source’s relational type system at the user’s request. The cited construction now directly supplies the recorded model; the former type-extension obligation is removed. Now satisfies: □Rigid Comprehension, □Atomicity, □Actuality, ND (type t), B for pure sentences. Now violates: □ND (type t), No Pure Contingency.
