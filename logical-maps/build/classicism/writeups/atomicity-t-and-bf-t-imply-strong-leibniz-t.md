# Atomicity (type t) ∧ BF (type t) ⇒ Strong Leibniz Biconditionals (type t)

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Philosophical Introduction to HOL (2024), Lean `Classicism.Map.atomicity_t_and_bf_t_imply_strong_leibniz_t`; produced by Andrew Bacon; set as Exercise 8.12, type-t instance written out by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 22 September 2026; recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 22 September 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **Atomicity (type t).** Atomicity (type t) in the displayed closed propositional formulation.
- **BF (type t).** BF (type t) in the displayed closed propositional formulation.

## Conclusion

- **Strong Leibniz Biconditionals (type t).** The type-t instance of the Strong Leibniz Biconditionals: every possible proposition is entailed by a strong world proposition, one that is possible and necessarily entails every proposition or its negation.

## Proof

Let $w$ be an atom below the possible $p$. For each $q$, $w\le q\lor w\le\neg q$ is true and, being a disjunction of two necessities, necessary by 4; so $\forall q\, .\,\Box(w\le q\lor w\le\neg q)$. BF (type t), for the property $\lambda q\, .\,w\le q\lor w\le\neg q$, gives $\Box\forall q\, .\,w\le q\lor w\le\neg q$. With $\Diamond w$, which is $w\ne\bot$, $w$ is a strong world.
