# Modal Freedom (signature Σ) ⇒ No Pure Contingency

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Misc., Lean `Classicism.Map.modal_freedom_signature_r_implies_no_pure_contingency_r`; produced by Cian Dorr, observation of 22 September 2026; proof written out by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 22 September 2026; recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 22 September 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **Modal Freedom (signature Σ).** For pure formulas P and Q with free variables among the disjoint tuples x and y, and distinct constants c and d of matching types, if P is possible at c and Q is possible at d then P and Q are jointly possible there.

## Conclusion

- **No Pure Contingency.** Each closed sentence of the pure language, if true, is necessary. This is a sentence schema, not a quantifier over propositions.

## Proof

Take both constant tuples empty and $Q:=\neg P$ for a closed pure $P$: the instance reads $\Diamond P\land\Diamond\neg P\to\Diamond(P\land\neg P)$, whose consequent is $\Diamond\bot$, false. So $\neg(\Diamond P\land\Diamond\neg P)$, i.e. $\Box P\lor\Box\neg P$, and with T, $P\to\Box P$.

## Notes

Records the observation, previously only in the principle’s notes, that the constant-free instance of Modal Freedom (signature Σ) is No Pure Contingency. With the recorded converse-direction facts, Modal Freedom (signature Σ) sits between No Contingency (signature Σ) and No Pure Contingency, and every model refuting No Pure Contingency refutes it.
