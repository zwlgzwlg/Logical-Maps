<p class='cert'>Model — Source: Classicism (2024); produced by Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr; recorded by OpenAI Codex (GPT-6), 17 September 2026.</p>

## Package

- **Rigid Power.** If a relation is rigid, so is the property of being a rigid relation that entails it.
- **Axiom of Infinity (type e).** There are not finitely many individuals. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **Axiom of Infinity (type t).** There are not finitely many propositions. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **Actuality.** There is a true proposition that entails every true proposition.
- **Distinctness-preserving collapse.** Every truth is necessary under the distinctness-preserving modality.
- **□Intensional Choice.** Every closed instance of Intensional Choice is necessary. Box the entire object-variable closure; retain the same type range and other schema side conditions.
- **No Pure Contingency.** Each closed sentence of the pure language, if true, is necessary. This is a sentence schema, not a quantifier over propositions.
- **Transversal Choice.** Every equivalence relation, at any type including e, has a transversal, that is, a property with exactly one instance in each of its cells.
- **¬ Atomicity.** Every non-bottom entity of each relational type has an atom below it.
- **¬ Atomicity (type t).** Atomicity (type t) in the displayed closed propositional formulation.
- **¬ BF.** The Barcan Formula at every type. The predicate formulation closes the formula schema using lambda abstraction.
- **¬ Boolean Completeness.** Every property of entities of a relational type has a greatest lower bound in that type.
- **¬ Countable Boolean Completeness.** Every countable property of entities of a relational type has a least upper bound in that type, where a property is countable when it injects into the natural numbers.
- **¬ Boolean Completeness (type t).** Boolean Completeness (type t) in the displayed closed propositional formulation.
- **¬ BF (type t).** BF (type t) in the displayed closed propositional formulation.
- **¬ B for sentences of Σ.** The B instance for every closed sentence of the language of the fixed signature Sigma.
- **¬ No Contingency (signature Σ).** Each closed sentence of the language of the fixed signature Sigma, if true, is necessary. A sentence schema, standing to No Pure Contingency as Possibility Maximalism (signature Σ) stands to Possibility Maximalism (pure).
- **¬ Witnessed Possibility.** For pure-formulas P with free variables among a finite tuple x, and distinct matching nonlogical constants c, a witness to P entails that P at those constants is possible.
- **¬ Separated Structure.** For each typed nonlogical constant c and closed same-typed terms F,G not containing c, equality after application to c implies equality of F and G.
- **¬ Independence (signature Σ).** No constant of Sigma is a pure operation applied to other constants: for a closed pure term A and distinct constants c, d_1,…,d_n with n ≥ 0, c differs from A applied to the d’s. With n = 0, no constant denotes a pure entity.
- **¬ Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ).** The Distinctness Maximalism schema for the fixed nonlogical signature Sigma.

## Definition

Proposition D.5, part 4 (p. 78): the arrows are the monotone maps $h$ of $\mathbb N$ with $h0=h1$, together with the identity. In every part, $W_0^\ddagger$ is the set of finite subsets of $\mathbb N$ and the model is ideally full: a proposition is a set of arrows whose membership depends only on the arrows’ values on some finite set of numbers (it is pinned down by that set), and an entity of a higher type is an applicative behaviour profile pinned down by a finite set in the same sense. The individuals are the natural numbers, acted on by the arrows themselves. Propositions and properties are thus about finitely many numbers and indifferent to how the arrows treat the rest. Evaluation point: the sole object, at the identity arrow.

Interpretation of Σ, fixed for this record: one designated relational constant $c$ of type $\tau=\bar\sigma t$ denotes $\lambda\bar x\, .\,a$, where $a$ is the unique true atom of the model, the actual-world proposition, whose only member is the identity arrow; every other constant of Σ, of which there is at least one, is relational and denotes the top element of its type.

## Arguments

### Holds Rigid Power.

Write $X_0(E)$ for the intension $k\mapsto k\cdot E$. For $E$ pinned down uniformly by a finite $S_0$, $X_0(E)$ is in the domain, pinned down by $S_0$, and so is $X_0(T)$ for every $T\subseteq E$ and $X_0(k\cdot E)$ for every arrow $k$. The extension at $k$ of the power property $\lambda X\, .\,\operatorname{Rigid}(X)\land X\le F$ is the set of rigid $X$ with $X\le k\cdot F$, the bound variable untransported and the parameter transported; by the condition, for rigid $F=X_0(S)$ it is $\{X_0(T'):T'\subseteq k\cdot S\}$, and transporting the extension at the identity along $k$ gives $\{X_0(k\cdot T):T\subseteq S\}$, the same set, since $T'\subseteq k\cdot S$ is $k\cdot T$ for $T:=\{s\in S:k\cdot s\in T'\}$. So the power property is $X_0$ of its own extension, which is pinned down uniformly, hence in the domain and rigid. In these models the rigid relations are thus (a) the haecceities, (b) the properties "being pinned down by $S$", which are $X_0(\operatorname{Pin}(S))$, and (c) the disjunctions, finite or infinite, of haecceities of entities pinned down by one finite set; the boxed form follows from No Pure Contingency.

*From the group *Finite-support action models on one object*, shared argument `finite-support-one-object#rigid-power`. It requires that Every rigid relation is the intension $k\mapsto k\cdot E$, the disjunction of the haecceities of the members of its extension $E$ at the identity, and $E$ is pinned down uniformly: some finite set pins down every member of $E$. Here: Let $Y$ be rigid, pinned down by $S=[0,s]$, with extension $E$ at the identity; rigidity makes $\bigcup\{k_2\cdot E:k_2\text{ agrees with }k\text{ on }S\}$ independent of $S$ among the sets pinning down $Y$. If some $p\in E$ were pinned minimally at $T$ with $t:=\max T>s$, take $s'\ge t$ and the jump map $k$, sending $0$ and $1$ to $0$, the identity on $[2,s']$ and adding $100$ beyond: an arrow agreeing with $k$ on $S$ and sending $t$ to $s'+1$ puts into the $S$-union an element pinned at $s'+1$, while every element of the $[0,s']$-union is pinned inside $k([0,s'])\cup[s'+100,\infty)$. So $E\subseteq\operatorname{Pin}(S)$, and then $k_2\cdot p=k\cdot p$ whenever $k_2$ agrees with $k$ on $S$, so $Y(k)=k\cdot E$.

### Holds Axiom of Infinity (type e).

The individuals are the natural numbers and identity at the evaluation arrow is literal, so no numeral counts them. The set of numerals at type $e$ is invariant under every arrow, hence has empty support and lies in the domain, so finite cardinality is standard and no finite cardinality holds of the universal property.

*From the group *Finite-support action models on one object*, shared argument `finite-support-one-object#axiom-of-infinity`. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-09-20.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Split from the argument for both types; the type-$t$ half, which does not need infinitely many individuals, is axiom-of-infinity-t.

### Holds Axiom of Infinity (type t).

The propositions that a given number is fixed by the arrow, one for each number, are pairwise distinct and each has that number as finite support, so there are infinitely many propositions. The set of numerals at type $t$ is invariant under every arrow, hence has empty support and lies in the domain, so finite cardinality is standard and no finite cardinality holds of the universal property.

*From the group *Finite-support action models on one object*, shared argument `finite-support-one-object#axiom-of-infinity-t`. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-09-20.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The type-$t$ half of the old argument, "individual" becoming "number", so that it covers the one-individual variants.

### Holds Actuality.

The actual-world proposition, whose only member is the identity, is then in the domain. It is true, and it entails every truth, since every true proposition contains the identity.

*Source: Classicism, Proposition D.5, parts 4, 5, 7 and 8, pp. 78–79. From the group *Finite-support action models on one object*, shared argument `finite-support-one-object#actual-world`. It requires that The singleton of the identity arrow is pinned down by a finite set. Here: The identity is the only arrow that does not collapse $0$ and $1$, so $\{1_{\mathbb N}\}$ is pinned down by $\{0,1\}$. By Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr, 2026-09-17.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Stated once for the group; each member's pinning set moved to the condition actual-world-pinned.

### Fails Atomicity, Atomicity (type t).

The only finitely pinned singleton is that of the identity, and every atom is a finitely pinned singleton, since two arrows in a proposition pinned down by $S$ that differ at $m$ are separated by a proposition pinned down by $S\cup\{m\}$. So the nonempty proposition of all arrows other than the identity has no atom below it. As the source puts it, the actual world is the only world, and Atomlessness restricted to false propositions holds.

*Source: Classicism, Proposition D.5(4), p. 78. From the group *Finite-support action models on one object*, shared argument `finite-support-one-object#collapsing-atomless`. It requires that The arrows other than the identity form a nonempty proposition pinned down by a finite set, and none of them has a singleton pinned down by a finite set. Here: The other arrows are those that collapse $0$ and $1$, pinned down by $\{0,1\}$, and a collapsing monotone map is not determined by its values on a finite set. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), from the source's remark, 2026-09-23.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The identity-or-collapse models' arguments (the source's for Atomicity, part 4 and "as in part 4"; Fable's for type $t$) stated once, with the step from atoms to singletons spelled out.

### Fails BF.

Witnessed by the qualitative property of being positive: an arrow sending $0$ to a positive number sends everything to positive numbers, so $\forall y\,\Box(Xz\to Xy)$ holds with $z:=0$ while $\Box\forall y(Xz\to Xy)$ fails.

*Source: Classicism, Proposition D.5, parts 3 and 4, pp. 77–78. From the group *Finite-support action models on one object*, shared argument `finite-support-one-object#barcan-positive`. It requires that Every arrow is monotone, and some arrow sends $0$ to a positive number. Here: Every arrow is monotone, and the arrows with $h0=h1=1$ send $0$ to a positive number. By Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr, 2026-09-17.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The monotone maps' argument (part 3), which part 4 invokes with "as in part 3", stated once.

### Fails Boolean Completeness.

At type $e\to t$. In the source's terms an upper bound of the haecceities of the members of $A$ is a persistent property whose extension contains $A$. A least one, pinned down by $\{0,\ldots,n\}$, would be the strongest such property pinned down by $\{0,\ldots,n\}$, and would also lie below the strongest pinned down by $\{0,\ldots,m\}$ for each $m>n$, which by the condition is strictly stronger. So the haecceities have no least upper bound.

*Source: Classicism, Proposition D.5, parts 1–8, pp. 75–79. From the group *Finite-support action models on one object*, shared argument `finite-support-one-object#boolean-completeness`. It requires that For some set $A$ of individuals, the strongest persistent property whose extension contains $A$ and which is pinned down by $\{0,\ldots,n\}$ becomes strictly stronger as $n$ grows. Here: As in parts 2 and 3, with $A$ the even numbers. By Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr, 2026-09-17.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Stated once for the group, with the step from "ever stronger" to the missing least upper bound spelled out; each member's strongest persistent properties moved to the condition unbounded-haecceities.

### Fails Countable Boolean Completeness.

At type $e\to t$: the property $E$ whose extension is the family of haecceities of the members of $A$, which has no least upper bound by the shared argument boolean-completeness, is countable, and the extensional fullness the source invokes to put $E$ in the domain also puts in the relation pairing the haecceity of the $k$-th member of $A$ with the numeral $k$, which injects $E$ into the numerals.

*From the group *Finite-support action models on one object*, shared argument `finite-support-one-object#countable-boolean-completeness`. It requires that For some set $A$ of individuals, the strongest persistent property whose extension contains $A$ and which is pinned down by $\{0,\ldots,n\}$ becomes strictly stronger as $n$ grows. Here: As in parts 2 and 3, with $A$ the even numbers. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-23.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Now builds on the shared argument boolean-completeness instead of on each member's source argument; no change of substance.

### Fails Boolean Completeness (type t).

The source (n. 92) conjectures this but does not show it. Any set $F$ of propositions is the extension at the identity of an element of the domain at type $t\to t$, namely the profile $\langle h,p\rangle\mapsto\{i : i\cdot p\in F\}$: it is natural, independent of $h$ and so pinned down by the empty set, and each of its values is pinned down by the pinning set of $p$, since $i\cdot p$ depends only on the values of $i$ there. A least upper bound of $F$ under entailment is a least finitely pinned superset of $\bigcup F$, and it exists only if the least $S$-pinned superset of $\bigcup F$ stops shrinking as the finite set $S$ grows. So the family $F$ of the condition has no least upper bound, and, taking pointwise negations, the family of complements has no greatest lower bound.

*From the group *Finite-support action models on one object*, shared argument `finite-support-one-object#boolean-completeness-t`. It requires that Some family $F$ of propositions has no least finitely pinned superset of its union $\bigcup F$. Here: Let $F$ be the family of propositions $A_m$ ($m\ge1$), each pinned down by $\{1,2m,2m+1\}$, that the arrow is constant on $\{1,\ldots,2m\}$ and increases at $2m+1$; the identity belongs to no $A_m$. The least superset of $\bigcup F$ pinned down by $\{0,\ldots,N\}$ consists of the non-identity arrows whose first increase after $1$ is at an odd position or beyond $N$, and it strictly shrinks as $N$ grows. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-25.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The seven members' copies stated once, each member's family moved to the condition no-least-pinned-cover; the truncations' separate argument of 23 September, by Claude Fable 5.1 prompted by Cian Dorr, is now its witness, its own proof that the family is in the domain giving way to the profile above. The trawl's second arguments for the same verdict (25 September, DeepSeek, reviewed by OpenAI Codex) were dropped.

### Fails BF (type t).

In a one-object finitely pinned model, BF (type t) fails as soon as there are a finite $N$, an arrow $i$ and a proposition $q$ in the domain that is the transport $i^{\prime}\cdot p=\{k : k\circ i^{\prime}\in p\}$ of no proposition $p$ along any arrow $i^{\prime}$ agreeing with $i$ on $N$: the intension $X:=\{\langle r,j\rangle : r\ne q\text{ or }j\text{ disagrees with }i\text{ on }N\}$, which the condition puts in the domain, contains $\langle i^{\prime}\cdot p,i^{\prime}\rangle$ for every $p$ and $i^{\prime}$, so $\forall p\, .\,\Box Xp$ holds at the identity, and omits $\langle q,i\rangle$, so $\Box\forall p\, .\,Xp$ fails there. Since membership of $k$ in $i^{\prime}\cdot p$ depends only on $k$ restricted to the range of $i^{\prime}$, it suffices that $q$ separate two arrows agreeing on every such range, as the condition provides.

*General argument `arguments/barcan-t-transport`. It requires that The model is a one-object action model whose entities are finitely pinned, and there are a finite set $N$, an arrow $i$ and a proposition $q$ in the domain such that $q$ separates two arrows that agree on the range of every arrow agreeing with $i$ on $N$, and the intension $\{\langle r,j\rangle : r\ne q\text{ or }j\text{ disagrees with }i\text{ on }N\}$ is in the domain. Here: Take $N=\{0\}$, $i$ any arrow with $i0=2$ (hence $i1=2$ and range within $[2,\infty)$), and $q:=\{k : k1=1\}$, pinned down by $\{1\}$: the arrows $k$ with $k0=k1=1\le k2$ and $k^{\prime}$ with $k^{\prime}0=k^{\prime}1=0$, agreeing beyond $1$, are separated by $q$. The model is a one-object finite-support model, and the intension the argument uses is pinned down by $N$. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), answering Cian Dorr’s question whether the failure of BF sharpens to type $t$, 2026-09-23.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The finite-support group's argument and the symmetric range-gap models' copies stated once for the topic; that $X$ is in the domain (pinned down by $N$, and in a symmetric model symmetric) is now part of each record's reason for meeting transport-gap.

### Holds Distinctness-preserving collapse.

For a true $p$, $a\le p$, since $a$ entails every truth. Take $q:=a$ in the definition of $\Box_{\ne}p$: at a world in $a$, $p$ holds; at a world outside $a$, $\Diamond a$ fails. So every truth is $\Box_{\ne}$-necessary.

*General argument `arguments/dpc-isolated-actual-world`. It requires that The actual-world proposition $a$ is in the domain and entails every truth, and no world outside $a$ sees a world in $a$. Here: The actual-world proposition, whose only member is the identity, is pinned down by a finite set, so it is in the domain and entails every truth; every other arrow is non-injective, so no composite with it is the identity. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-23.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The finite-support, symmetric and full action models' copies (eight records) stated once for the topic; what varied, why no world outside the actual world sees back into it, is each record's reason for meeting actual-world-isolated.

### Holds □Intensional Choice.

For each object $U$ and type $\sigma$ fix a well-ordering $<_U$ of the domain $D^\sigma_U$, and let $W$ be the intension of type $\sigma\to\sigma\to t$ with $W(h):={<_{\operatorname{cod}h}}$. Its value depends only on the arrow's codomain, so by the condition it is in the domain, and at every world its extension well-orders that world's type-$\sigma$ domain. Given $F$ with $\Box\exists x\, .\,Fx$, put $G:=\lambda x\, .\,Fx\land\forall y\, .\,(Fy\to\neg Wyx)$, the $W$-least $F$. It is definable from $F$ and $W$, so in the domain; $G\le F$, and its extension at every arrow is the singleton of the least element of $F$'s. So Intensional Choice holds, and the same at every reachable object gives $\Box$Intensional Choice. Cian Dorr's observation that such models are qualitatively full, made precise.

*General argument `arguments/intensional-choice-well-ordering`. It requires that At every object reachable from the evaluation point, the domain contains every intension whose value at an arrow depends only on the arrow's codomain. Here: With one object such an intension is constant, so it is pinned down by $\emptyset$, and the domain holds every finitely pinned intension. It requires that The model is constructed in a metatheory with the axiom of choice. Here: The construction is carried out in ZFC (Appendix D). By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's suggestion, 2026-10-03.*

### Holds No Pure Contingency.

Closed pure terms denote entities fixed by every arrow (§3.5, p. 58). With a single object, a proposition fixed by every arrow contains every arrow if it contains the identity and no arrow otherwise, so a true closed pure sentence is necessary: the source's one-object No Pure Contingency observation (p. 79), applied to each closed instance.

*Source: Classicism, §3.5, p. 58; p. 79. General argument `arguments/no-pure-contingency-one-object`. It requires that The model is an action model (Classicism, Appendix D), or an intensional action model in the sense of Dorr's draft (Boolean Completeness does not imply Rigid Comprehension), with a single object. Here: Each part of Proposition D.5 is a one-object category acting on $\mathbb N$ (Appendix D, Definitions D.1–D.3). By Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr, 2026-09-17.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Moved from the group finite-support-one-object to the topic, for every one-object action model; the reason the source's observation holds is spelled out in place of "Boxed positive flags use the source’s explicit one-object No Pure Contingency observation, applied separately to each closed instance."

### Fails B for sentences of Σ.

B for sentences of Σ fails: the Σ-sentence $\forall\bar x\, .\,c\bar x$ denotes $a$, which is true, and under an arrow from which no world in $a$ is accessible $\Diamond a$ is false, so $\Box\Diamond a$ fails.

*General argument `arguments/sigma-true-atom-b`. It requires that Σ has a designated relational constant $c$ of type $\tau=\bar\sigma t$ denoting $\lambda\bar x\, .\,a$, where $a$ is the actual-world proposition, the unique true atom; every other constant, of which there is at least one, is relational and denotes the top element of its type. Here: This is the interpretation. It requires that The actual-world proposition $a$, the strongest truth, is in the domain; it is necessary at no world, and some arrow does not fix it. Here: The actual-world proposition is in the domain, being pinned down by a finite set; at every arrow some composite is not the identity, since every other arrow is non-injective, so it is necessary at no arrow, and a non-identity arrow carries it to the empty set. It requires that Some world sees no world at which the actual-world proposition is true. Here: A non-identity arrow is non-injective, so no arrow composes it back to the identity. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr’s request, 2026-09-22.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The B clause of the records' Σ-as-true-atom argument, stated once for the topic.

### Fails No Contingency (signature Σ), Witnessed Possibility, Separated Structure, Independence (signature Σ), Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ).

No Contingency (signature Σ) fails, since the Σ-sentence $\forall\bar x\, .\,c\bar x$ denotes $a$, true and contingent; Witnessed Possibility fails for the pure formula $x=\top_\tau$, witnessed by $\top_\tau$, since $\Diamond(c=\top_\tau)$ is $\Diamond\Box a$ and $a$ is necessary at no world; Separated Structure fails with it, being equivalent to Possibly Witnessed Possibility; Independence (signature Σ) and Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ) fail through the other relational constants: such a constant $c'$ of type $\tau'$ denotes what the closed pure term $\top_{\tau'}$ denotes, and $c'=\top_{\tau'}$ is a true identity that C(Σ) does not prove. The designated constant refutes neither: closed pure terms denote entities fixed by every arrow (Classicism, §3.5, p. 58), whereas some arrow does not fix $a$, so no closed pure term denotes $\lambda\bar x\, .\,a$.

*General argument `arguments/sigma-true-atom`. It requires that Σ has a designated relational constant $c$ of type $\tau=\bar\sigma t$ denoting $\lambda\bar x\, .\,a$, where $a$ is the actual-world proposition, the unique true atom; every other constant, of which there is at least one, is relational and denotes the top element of its type. Here: This is the interpretation. It requires that The actual-world proposition $a$, the strongest truth, is in the domain; it is necessary at no world, and some arrow does not fix it. Here: The actual-world proposition is in the domain, being pinned down by a finite set; at every arrow some composite is not the identity, since every other arrow is non-injective, so it is necessary at no arrow, and a non-identity arrow carries it to the empty set. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr’s request, 2026-09-22.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The verbatim copies in ten records (finite-support, symmetric and full action models) stated once for the topic. Its B clause is now sigma-true-atom-b, which needs an arrow from which the actual world is out of reach. "$a$ is fixed by no arrow but the identity" became "some arrow does not fix $a$": in a symmetric model the actual-world proposition is the symmetry group, which its members fix, and the conclusion needs only the weaker claim.

### Holds Transversal Choice.

For an equivalence relation at the evaluation point, a transversal of its extension there, chosen in the metatheory, is by extensional fullness the extension of an element of the domain; the equivalence and transversal conditions are unboxed.

*General argument `arguments/transversal-choice-extensionally-full`. It requires that The model is extensionally full at every object: every set of tuples from the domains at an object is the extension, at the identity arrow, of an element of the domain of the matching relational type there. Here: The model is ideally full, hence extensionally full at every object (Appendix D, the remark after Definition D.3): for any set $R$ of tuples from the domains at an object $V$, the intension that assigns to every arrow out of $V$ into an object $U$ a fixed set $R_U$ of tuples from $U$’s domains, with $R_V=R$, is pinned down by $\emptyset$, so it is the intension of an element of $V^{\bar\sigma\to t}$ with extension $R$ at $1_V$. It requires that The model is constructed in a metatheory with the axiom of choice. Here: The construction is carried out in ZFC (Appendix D). By Cian Dorr (observation); recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), on a question of Zachary Goodsell, after an observation of Christopher Sun, 2026-09-25.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The Relational Choice and Transversal Choice arguments merged into one, stated for every extensionally full model.

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Moved from the group finite-support-one-object to the topic. Its first sentence, deriving extensional fullness from ideal fullness, is now the group's reason for meeting extensionally-full.


## Notes

The cited construction is a model of the map’s relational-type framework. The description identifies its evaluation point; construction and verification are given at the PDF locations in References. Everything that implies these fails with them.

## History

The record's revision log before it was written as arguments.

- **2026-09-25** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added Transversal Choice, by the argument recorded for Relational Choice: the model is extensionally full at every object, so for an equivalence relation at the evaluation point a transversal of its extension there, chosen in the metatheory, is the extension of an element pinned down by the empty set; the equivalence and transversal conditions are unboxed. Recorded on a question of Zachary Goodsell, after an observation of Christopher Sun. Now satisfies: Transversal Choice.
- **2026-09-25** (OpenAI Codex (GPT-6)) — Confirmed the trawl's BC-t conclusion with a replacement proof: alternating differences of finite agreement classes have no least upper bound. The original missing-intersection argument is invalid. Used source extensional fullness for domain membership. Also localized the source-reported Atomicity failure to t (footnote 92), with a corrected direct splitting proof. Now violates: Boolean Completeness (type t), Atomicity (type t).
- **2026-09-25** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added the failure of Atomicity (type t), of BF (type t) and of Boolean Completeness (type t), with the arguments in the notes. Now violates: Atomicity (type t), BF (type t), Boolean Completeness (type t).
- **2026-09-25** (Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic)) — Merged the two sets of arguments recorded on 23 and 25 September into one, keeping the 23 September arguments for Atomicity (type t) and BF (type t).
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Expanded the description from Appendix D, naming Proposition D.5 and its part; added the failure of Countable Boolean Completeness at type e→t; settled the Distinctness-preserving collapse. Now satisfies: Distinctness-preserving collapse. Now violates: Countable Boolean Completeness.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Re-fixed the interpretation of Σ so as to settle No Contingency (signature Σ) and B for sentences of Σ, at Cian Dorr’s request; see the notes. Now violates: No Contingency (signature Σ), B for sentences of Σ.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Corrected the reason given for the failures of Independence (signature Σ) and Distinctness (signature Σ): the true atom is denoted by no closed pure term, since such terms denote entities fixed by every arrow; the failures come from the other relational constants, which denote top. No verdict changes.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added Relational Choice and its necessitation at Cian Dorr’s direction: ideally full models are extensionally full at every object, and choice in the metatheory supplies the functional subrelation; see the notes. Now satisfies: Relational Choice, □Relational Choice.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Recorded the failure of BF at type t, sharpening the failure of BF; argument in the notes. Now violates: BF (type t).
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Recorded the failure of Atomicity (type t), and with it of the Strong Leibniz Biconditionals; see the notes. Now violates: Atomicity (type t).
- **2026-09-22** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Fixed an interpretation of Σ (relational constants as top, individual constants as one fixed individual) and recorded the signature schemata it refutes, at Cian Dorr’s request. Now violates: Witnessed Possibility, Separated Structure, Independence (signature Σ), Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ).
- **2026-09-20** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added both Axioms of Infinity at Cian Dorr's direction. The individuals are the natural numbers and identity at the evaluation arrow is literal, so no numeral counts them. The propositions that a given individual is fixed by the arrow, one for each individual, are pairwise distinct and each has that individual as finite support, so there are infinitely many propositions. The set of numerals at each type is invariant under every arrow, hence has empty support and lies in the domain, so finite cardinality is standard and no finite cardinality holds of the universal property at either type. Now satisfies: Axiom of Infinity (type e), Axiom of Infinity (type t).
- **2026-09-17** (OpenAI Codex (GPT-6)) — Adopted the source’s relational type system at the user’s request. The cited construction now directly supplies the recorded model; the former type-extension obligation is removed. Now satisfies: Actuality, No Pure Contingency, □Actuality. Now violates: ND, Atomicity, BF, Boolean Completeness, Rigid Comprehension.
