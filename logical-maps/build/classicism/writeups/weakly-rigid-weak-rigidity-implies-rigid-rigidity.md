# Weakly Rigid Weak Rigidity ⇒ Rigid Rigidity

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Misc., Lean `Classicism.Map.weakly_rigid_weak_rigidity_implies_rigid_rigidity`; produced by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), 10 October 2026, checking a suggestion of Cian Dorr; recorded by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), 10 October 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **Weakly Rigid Weak Rigidity.** Being weakly rigid is a weakly rigid property of relations, including propositions.

## Conclusion

- **Rigid Rigidity.** Being rigid is a rigid property of relations, including propositions.

## Proof

Fix the type tuple $\bar\sigma$, with $W:=\lambda Y\, .\,\operatorname{WeaklyRigid}(Y)$ and $R:=\lambda Y\, .\,\operatorname{Rigid}(Y)$. By weakly-rigid-weak-rigidity-implies-necessary-tame-rigidity at $\bar\sigma$, and T for the converse, $W$ and $R$ are necessarily coextensive, hence identical; so $R$ is weakly rigid. The same result at the one-element tuple $(\bar\sigma t)$ gives Tame Rigidity for properties of type $(\bar\sigma t)t$, so $R$ is rigid. The argument uses the principle at two types.
