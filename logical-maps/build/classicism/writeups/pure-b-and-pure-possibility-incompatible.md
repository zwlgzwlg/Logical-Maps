# B for pure sentences ∧ Possibility Maximalism (pure) ⇒ ⊥

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Philosophical Introduction to HOL (2024); produced by Andrew Bacon; set as Exercise 8.19, solution written out by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 22 September 2026; recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 22 September 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **B for pure sentences.** The B instance for every closed sentence in the pure language.
- **Possibility Maximalism (pure).** Every closed pure sentence consistent with C is possible.

## Conclusion

- **⊥.** These premises cannot all hold together.

## Proof

Let $F$ be the Fregean Axiom, a closed pure sentence. Both $F$ and $\neg F$ are consistent with C (a two-valued Henkin model and the two-element-group model), so Possibility Maximalism (pure) gives $\Diamond F$ and $\Diamond\neg F$. In C, $\Box(F\to\Box F)$: the Fregean Axiom, if true, makes every truth identical to $\top$, and this reasoning is a theorem, so it holds necessarily. If $F$ then $\Box F$, contradicting $\Diamond\neg F$. If $\neg F$, B for the pure sentence $\neg F$ gives $\Box\Diamond\neg F$; but at the possibility where $F$ holds, $\Box F$ holds, so $\neg\Diamond\neg F$ holds there, a contradiction.

## Notes

Sharpens the recorded incompatibility of Possibility Maximalism (pure) with No Pure Contingency and with ND: even B restricted to pure sentences is excluded.
