# Possibility Maximalism (signature Σ) ⇒ Possibility Maximalism (pure)

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Misc., Lean `Classicism.Map.possibility_signature_r_implies_possibility_schema_r`; produced by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 23 September 2026, following an observation of Cian Dorr’s of the same day; recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 23 September 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **Possibility Maximalism (signature Σ).** The Possibility Maximalism schema for the fixed nonlogical signature Sigma.

## Conclusion

- **Possibility Maximalism (pure).** Every closed pure sentence consistent with C is possible.

## Proof

Let $P$ be a closed pure sentence consistent with C. By the completeness half of Classicism, Theorem 3.23, some action model makes $P$ true. An action model carries an interpretation of the nonlogical constants (Definition 3.25 refers to it), and the frame with any interpretation of the constants of Σ in the domains of their types, nonempty by Existence, is again an action model, in which $P$ remains true, $P$ containing no constants. By the soundness half of the same theorem, applied to the language $\mathcal L(\Sigma)$, every theorem of C(Σ) is true in it. So $P$ is consistent with C(Σ), and Possibility Maximalism (signature Σ) gives $\Diamond P$.

## Notes

Records that the signature-expanded reference theory is conservative over C for pure sentences, which is what the arrow from the Σ form of Possibility Maximalism to the pure form needs. The analogous arrow between the two Strong Possibility principles remains conjectured, since it needs the conservativity of Max(C(Σ)) over Max(C), which this argument does not give: a model of Max(C) with the constants interpreted arbitrarily need not satisfy the possibility of every C(Σ)-consistent Σ-sentence.
