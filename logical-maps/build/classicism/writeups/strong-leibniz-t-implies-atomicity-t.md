# Strong Leibniz Biconditionals (type t) ⇒ Atomicity (type t)

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Philosophical Introduction to HOL (2024), Lean `Classicism.Map.strong_leibniz_t_implies_atomicity_t`; produced by Andrew Bacon; type-t instance recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 22 September 2026; recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 22 September 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **Strong Leibniz Biconditionals (type t).** The type-t instance of the Strong Leibniz Biconditionals: every possible proposition is entailed by a strong world proposition, one that is possible and necessarily entails every proposition or its negation.

## Conclusion

- **Atomicity (type t).** Atomicity (type t) in the displayed closed propositional formulation.

## Proof

A strong world proposition is an atom: from $\Box\forall q\, .\,w\le q\lor w\le\neg q$, T gives $\forall q\, .\,w\le q\lor w\le\neg q$, and with $w\ne\bot$ this is $\operatorname{Atom}_t(w)$. A possible $p$ is a non-bottom $p$. So the strong world below $p$ is an atom below it.
