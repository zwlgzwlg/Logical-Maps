# Strong Leibniz Biconditionals (type t) ⇒ □Actuality

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Misc.; produced by Cian Dorr, 26 September 2026; the omission was noticed by Branden Fitelson; recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 26 September 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **Strong Leibniz Biconditionals (type t).** The type-t instance of the Strong Leibniz Biconditionals: every possible proposition is entailed by a strong world proposition, one that is possible and necessarily entails every proposition or its negation.

## Conclusion

- **□Actuality.** Every closed instance of Actuality is necessary. Box the entire object-variable closure; retain the same type range and other schema side conditions.

## Proof

Write $A$ for Actuality, $\exists p\, .\,p\land\forall q\, .\,q\to p\le q$. Every strong world proposition entails $A$. For any $w$, $(\forall q\, .\,w\le q\lor w\le\neg q)\to(w\to A)$ is a theorem of H: given $w$ and a true $q$, $w\le\neg q$ would give $\neg q$ by T, so $w\le q$; thus $w$ is true and entails every truth, and is itself the witness for $A$. Necessitate the universal closure in $w$, distribute by CBF, and apply K to the second conjunct of $\operatorname{SWorld}_t(w)$, which is $\Box\forall q\, .\,w\le q\lor w\le\neg q$: this gives $\Box(w\to A)$, i.e. $w\le A$. Now suppose $\Diamond\neg A$. The Strong Leibniz Biconditionals at type $t$ supply a strong world $w$ with $w\le\neg A$. Together with $w\le A$ this gives $w\le A\land\neg A=\bot$, so $w=\bot$, contradicting $\Diamond w$. Hence $\neg\Diamond\neg A$, which is $\Box A$. Actuality has no type parameters, so $\Box A$ is its only closed instance.

## Notes

The map already had □Actuality from Atomicity and BF (Proposition 2.7) and from □Plenitude and □Rigid Comprehension. This record is stronger in one direction: only the type-$t$ instance of the Strong Leibniz Biconditionals is used, so with the recorded derivation of that instance from Atomicity (type $t$) and BF (type $t$), □Actuality now follows from those two type-$t$ principles without BF at other types. Every model in the map that satisfies the Strong Leibniz Biconditionals already satisfied □Actuality, so no recorded verdict changes.

The recorded derivation of □Actuality from Atomicity and BF goes through the same step, that a world proposition entails Actuality, using Tractarianism to combine the case split; a strong world has the combined form built in.
