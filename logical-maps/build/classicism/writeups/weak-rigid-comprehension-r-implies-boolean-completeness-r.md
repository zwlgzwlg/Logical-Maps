# Weak Rigid Comprehension ⇒ Boolean Completeness

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: BC does not imply RC (draft), Lean `Classicism.Map.weak_rigid_comprehension_r_implies_boolean_completeness_r`; produced by Cian Dorr; recorded by Claude Opus 5 (Anthropic), 19 September 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **Weak Rigid Comprehension.** Every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a weakly rigid one, that is, with one that is persistent and weakly inextensible.

## Conclusion

- **Boolean Completeness.** Every property of entities of a relational type has a greatest lower bound in that type.

## Proof

Take the propositional case first. Given $F^{tt}$, let $C^{tt}$ be weakly rigid and coextensive with $F$, and put $q:=\exists p\, .\,Cp\land p$. Every $F$ proposition $p$ is $C$, hence necessarily $C$ by persistence, so $p$ entails $Cp\land p$ and thereby $q$; so $q$ is an upper bound of the $F$ propositions. Now suppose every $F$ proposition entails $r$. The $C$ propositions are the $F$ propositions, so every $C$ proposition entails $r$; entailments are necessary if true, so $\forall p\, .\,Cp\to\Box(p\le r)$. Weak inextensibility with $X:=\lambda p\, .\,(p\le r)$ gives $C\le X$, so at every world $Cp$ implies $p\le r$; hence $Cp\land p$ entails $r$ whatever $p$ may be, and $q\le r$. So $q$ is a least upper bound of the $F$ propositions. The same reasoning with extra parameters gives the least-upper-bound form at every relational type, and that form is equivalent in C to the greatest-lower-bound form in which the principle is stated.
