# Atomicity (type t) ∧ BF ⇒ □Actuality

## Premises

- **Atomicity (type t).** Atomicity (type t) in the displayed closed propositional formulation.
- **BF.** The Barcan Formula at every type. The predicate formulation closes the formula schema using lambda abstraction.

## Conclusion

- **□Actuality.** Necessarily, there is a true proposition that entails every true proposition.

## Proof

If w is a propositional atom, it entails every conditional $q\to(w\le q)$: either it entails q, in which case the entailment is necessary, or it entails its negation. Tractarianism, equivalent to BF, combines these into the universal claim that w entails every truth. Hence w entails Actuality. Atomicity says every possible proposition has an atom below it, so no possible proposition can entail the negation of Actuality. Thus that negation is $\bot$ and Actuality is necessary.

## Notes

The displayed proof uses only the type-t Atomicity instance. BF retains its stated type-schematic scope; no weakening of its range is inferred.
