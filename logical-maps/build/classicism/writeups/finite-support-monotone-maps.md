# Finite-support action model: monotone maps of N

<p class='cert'>Model — Source: Classicism (2024); produced by Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr; recorded by OpenAI Codex (GPT-6), 17 September 2026.</p>

## Package

- **Atomlessness.** Atomlessness in the displayed closed propositional formulation.
- **No Pure Contingency.** Each closed sentence of the pure language, if true, is necessary. This is a sentence schema, not a quantifier over propositions.
- **Axiom of Infinity (type e).** There are not finitely many individuals. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **Relational Choice.** Every serial binary relation has a functional subrelation.
- **Transversal Choice.** Every equivalence relation, at any type including e, has a transversal, that is, a property with exactly one instance in each of its cells.
- **Axiom of Infinity (type t).** There are not finitely many propositions. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **□Relational Choice.** Necessarily, every serial binary relation has a functional subrelation.
- **¬ BF.** The Barcan Formula at every type. The predicate formulation closes the formula schema using lambda abstraction.
- **¬ Boolean Completeness.** Every property of entities of a relational type has a greatest lower bound in that type.
- **¬ Witnessed Possibility.** For pure-formulas P with free variables among a finite tuple x, and distinct matching nonlogical constants c, a witness to P entails that P at those constants is possible.
- **¬ No Contingency (signature Σ).** Each closed sentence of the language of the fixed signature Sigma, if true, is necessary. A sentence schema, standing to No Pure Contingency as Possibility Maximalism (signature Σ) stands to Possibility Maximalism (pure).
- **¬ Countable Boolean Completeness.** Every countable property of entities of a relational type has a least upper bound in that type, where a property is countable when it injects into the natural numbers.
- **¬ Distinctness-preserving collapse.** Every truth is necessary under the distinctness-preserving modality.
- **¬ Weakly Inextensible Comprehension.** Every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a weakly inextensible one.
- **¬ BF (type t).** BF (type t) in the displayed closed propositional formulation.
- **¬ Boolean Completeness (type t).** Boolean Completeness (type t) in the displayed closed propositional formulation.
- **¬ Vicinity.** There is a true proposition that entails the possibility of each true proposition.
- **¬ ND.** Distinct things of any type are necessarily distinct.
- **¬ Atomicity.** Every non-bottom entity of each relational type has an atom below it.
- **¬ Actuality.** There is a true proposition that entails every true proposition.
- **¬ Rigid Comprehension.** Every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a rigid one.
- **¬ Separated Structure.** For each typed nonlogical constant c and closed same-typed terms F,G not containing c, equality after application to c implies equality of F and G.
- **¬ Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ).** The Distinctness Maximalism schema for the fixed nonlogical signature Sigma.
- **¬ Inextensible Comprehension.** Every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a inextensible one.

## Definition

Proposition D.5, part 3 (p. 77): the one-object category whose arrows are all the monotone maps of $\mathbb N$. In every part, $W_0^\ddagger$ is the set of finite subsets of $\mathbb N$ and the model is ideally full: a proposition is a set of arrows whose membership depends only on the arrows’ values on some finite set of individuals (it is pinned down by that set), an entity of a higher type is an applicative behaviour profile pinned down by a finite set in the same sense, and the individuals are the natural numbers acted on by the arrows themselves. Propositions and properties are thus about finitely many individuals and indifferent to how the arrows treat the rest. Evaluation point: the sole object, at the identity arrow.

Interpretation of Σ, fixed for this record: one designated relational constant $c$ of type $\tau=\bar\sigma t$ denotes $\lambda\bar x\, .\,p_0$, where $p_0$ is the proposition that the arrow fixes $0$, pinned down by $\{0\}$; every other relational constant denotes the top element of its type and every individual constant one fixed individual.

## Arguments

### Fails BF.

The source notes that with all maps BF would still hold, since every map agrees on any finite set with a surjection; monotonicity makes it fail, witnessed by the qualitative property of being positive: any monotone map sending $0$ to a positive number sends everything to positive numbers, so $\forall y\,\Box(Xz\to Xy)$ holds with $z:=0$ while $\Box\forall y(Xz\to Xy)$ fails.

### Holds Atomlessness. Fails Boolean Completeness.

As in part 2.

### Holds No Pure Contingency.

Boxed positive flags use the source’s explicit one-object No Pure Contingency observation, applied separately to each closed instance.

*Source: Classicism, p. 79. By Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr, 2026-09-17.*

### Holds Axiom of Infinity (type e).

The individuals are the natural numbers and identity at the evaluation arrow is literal, so no numeral counts them. The propositions that a given individual is fixed by the arrow, one for each individual, are pairwise distinct and each has that individual as finite support, so there are infinitely many propositions. The set of numerals at each type is invariant under every arrow, hence has empty support and lies in the domain, so finite cardinality is standard and no finite cardinality holds of the universal property at either type.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-09-20.*

### Fails Witnessed Possibility, No Contingency (signature Σ).

No Contingency (signature Σ) fails, since $\forall\bar x\, .\,c\bar x$ denotes $p_0$, true and false at the constant map to $1$. Witnessed Possibility fails for the pure formula $x=\top_\tau$, witnessed by $\top_\tau$: $\Diamond(c=\top_\tau)$ is $\Diamond\Box p_0$, and $\Box p_0$ holds at no arrow $h$, since the constant map to $1$ composed after $h$ moves $0$. Separated Structure fails with it, being equivalent to Possibly Witnessed Possibility. Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ) fails by derivation, since Possibility Maximalism (pure) fails here. Whether $c$ denotes what some closed pure term denotes is not settled, so Independence (signature Σ) is left unknown. The choice of a contingent rather than a pure denotation is deliberate: this is the only recorded model of Atomlessness in which No Contingency (signature Σ) is refuted, the others being one-object models with pure interpretations of the constants.

*Revised 2026-09-23 by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic):* Re-fixed the interpretation of Σ so that the designated constant denotes a contingent proposition, refuting No Contingency (signature Σ) and settling the open question whether Atomlessness implies it; Independence (signature Σ) is no longer claimed for this model.

### Fails Countable Boolean Completeness.

At type $e\to t$: the property $E$ that the source shows to lack a least upper bound has as its extension a countable family of haecceities, and the extensional fullness the source invokes to put $E$ in the domain also puts in the relation pairing the haecceity of the $k$-th member of that family with the numeral $k$, which injects $E$ into the numerals.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-23.*

### Fails Distinctness-preserving collapse.

The shift $h$ that fixes $0,\ldots,m-1$ and adds one to everything from $m$ on is a monotone injection, so for any true $q$ pinned down by a finite $Y$ a monotone $k$ with $k(hy)=y$ on $Y$ exists and $k\circ h\in q$; thus $\Diamond q$ holds at $h$, while the true proposition that $m$ is fixed is false there.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-23.*

### Holds Relational Choice.

The model is ideally full, hence extensionally full at every object (Appendix D, the remark after Definition D.3): for any set $R$ of tuples from the domains at an object $V$, the intension that assigns to every arrow out of $V$ into an object $U$ a fixed set $R_U$ of tuples from $U$’s domains, with $R_V=R$, is pinned down by $\emptyset$, so it is the intension of an element of $V^{\bar\sigma\to t}$ with extension $R$ at $1_V$. Given a relation $U$ serial at $V$, choose for each $x$ a $y$ with $(Ux)y$, by choice in the metatheory; the graph is such an $R$, and its element $S$ is functional and a subrelation of $U$ at $1_V$, both conditions being unboxed. The closed Relational Choice instance is true at an arrow $h\colon W_0\to V$ iff it is true at $1_V$ in the truncation by $h$, whose domains at $V$ are those of the model, so it holds at every arrow and $\Box$Relational Choice follows.

### Fails Weakly Inextensible Comprehension.

At type $e\to t$, for the property of being even, which is in the domain as the constant intension $\{\langle b,h\rangle : b\text{ even}\}$, pinned down by $\emptyset$. Unpacking $\operatorname{Inextensible}$ as in the left-to-right half of Dorr’s rigidity criterion (draft, Lemma 14, p. 7, with Lemma 13): even the unboxed matrix, evaluated at the identity, says that $Y$ is contained in every persistent (transport-closed) $B$ in the domain whose extension includes $Y$’s. For a finite $N^{\prime}$, the smallest such $B$ pinned down by $N^{\prime}$ is $B_{N^{\prime}}:=\{\langle b^{\prime\prime},i^{\prime}\rangle : i^{\prime\prime}(b)=b^{\prime\prime}\text{ for some even }b\text{ and some arrow }i^{\prime\prime}\text{ agreeing with }i^{\prime}\text{ on }N^{\prime}\}$, which is transport-closed and pinned down by $N^{\prime}$. Now let $Y$ be coextensive with evenness and pinned down by a finite $N_0\subseteq[0,M_0]$; then $\langle b,i\rangle\in Y$ for every even $b$ and every arrow $i$ fixing $N_0$ pointwise. Take $i$ the monotone map that is the identity on $[0,M_0]$ and adds one beyond it; an even $b>M_0+1$, whose only preimage under $i$ is the odd $b-1$; and $N^{\prime}:=[0,b]$: a monotone map agreeing with $i$ there has the same preimages of $b$ within $[0,b]$ and takes values at least $i(b)=b+1$ beyond it. So $\langle b,i\rangle\in Y\setminus B_{N^{\prime}}$, and $Y$ is not even weakly inextensible.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), answering Cian Dorr’s question whether the failure of Actuality can be sharpened to a failure of Inextensible Comprehension, 2026-09-23.*

*Revised 2026-09-25 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic):* Merged the two sets of arguments recorded on 23 and 25 September into one, keeping the 23 September arguments for Inextensible Comprehension and BF (type t); the former already refutes the weak form.

### Fails BF (type t).

In a one-object finitely pinned model, BF (type t) fails as soon as there are a finite $N$, an arrow $i$ and a proposition $q$ in the domain that is the transport $i^{\prime}\cdot p=\{k : k\circ i^{\prime}\in p\}$ of no proposition $p$ along any arrow $i^{\prime}$ agreeing with $i$ on $N$: the intension $X:=\{\langle r,j\rangle : r\ne q\text{ or }j\text{ disagrees with }i\text{ on }N\}$ is pinned down by $N$, contains $\langle i^{\prime}\cdot p,i^{\prime}\rangle$ for every $p$ and $i^{\prime}$, so $\forall p\, .\,\Box Xp$ holds at the identity, and omits $\langle q,i\rangle$, so $\Box\forall p\, .\,Xp$ fails there. Since membership of $k$ in $i^{\prime}\cdot p$ depends only on $k$ restricted to the range of $i^{\prime}$, it suffices that $q$ separate two arrows agreeing on every such range. Here take $N=\{0\}$, $i$ any monotone map with $i0=2$, so that every $i^{\prime}$ agreeing with it on $N$ has range within $[2,\infty)$, and $q:=\{k : k1=1\}$, pinned down by $\{1\}$: two monotone maps agreeing on $[2,\infty)$ with $k2\ge1$ may take the values $1$ and $0$ at $1$.

### Holds Transversal Choice.

By the argument recorded for Relational Choice: the model is extensionally full at every object, so for an equivalence relation at the evaluation point a transversal of its extension there, chosen in the metatheory, is the extension of an element pinned down by the empty set; the equivalence and transversal conditions are unboxed.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), on a question of Zachary Goodsell, after an observation of Christopher Sun, 2026-09-25.*

### Fails Boolean Completeness (type t).

The source (n. 92) conjectures this but does not show it. Any set $F$ of propositions is the extension at the identity of an element of the domain at type $t\to t$, namely the profile $\langle h,p\rangle\mapsto\{i : i\cdot p\in F\}$: it is natural, independent of $h$ and so pinned down by the empty set, and each of its values is pinned down by the pinning set of $p$, since $i\cdot p$ depends only on the values of $i$ there. A least upper bound of $F$ under entailment is a least finitely pinned superset of $\bigcup F$, and it exists only if the least $S$-pinned superset of $\bigcup F$ stops shrinking as the finite set $S$ grows. Here let $A_m$ ($m\ge1$) be the proposition, pinned down by $\{0,2m-1,2m\}$, that the arrow is constant on $\{0,\ldots,2m-1\}$ and first changes value at $2m$. The least superset of $\bigcup_mA_m$ pinned down by $\{0,\ldots,N\}$ consists of the arrows whose first change of value is at an even position or beyond $N$, and it strictly shrinks as $N$ grows. So $F$ has no least upper bound, and, taking pointwise negations, the family of complements has no greatest lower bound.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-25.*

### Fails Vicinity.

A true $w$ pinned down by a finite set $S$ contains every arrow agreeing with the identity on $S$, among them the monotone map equal to the identity up to $M$ and constant at $M+1$ beyond it, for $S\subseteq[0,M]$, one that collapses two individuals $a\ne b$ outside $S$. The proposition that $a$ and $b$ are distinct is true, and it is possible at no arrow that collapses them, since a collapse persists under composition, so $w\not\le\Diamond(a\ne b)$.

### Fails ND, Atomicity, Actuality, Rigid Comprehension. In reserve.

*Source: Classicism, Appendix D, Proposition D.5(3), pp. 74–75; construction p. 77; p. 79 (No Pure Contingency). By Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr, 2026-09-17.*

### Holds Axiom of Infinity (type t). In reserve.

Added both Axioms of Infinity at Cian Dorr's direction. The individuals are the natural numbers and identity at the evaluation arrow is literal, so no numeral counts them. The propositions that a given individual is fixed by the arrow, one for each individual, are pairwise distinct and each has that individual as finite support, so there are infinitely many propositions. The set of numerals at each type is invariant under every arrow, hence has empty support and lies in the domain, so finite cardinality is standard and no finite cardinality holds of the universal property at either type.

### Fails Separated Structure, Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ). In reserve.

Fixed an interpretation of Σ (relational constants as top, individual constants as one fixed individual) and recorded the signature schemata it refutes, at Cian Dorr’s request.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-22.*

### Holds □Relational Choice. In reserve.

Added Relational Choice and its necessitation at Cian Dorr’s direction: ideally full models are extensionally full at every object, and choice in the metatheory supplies the functional subrelation; see the notes.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-23.*

### Fails Inextensible Comprehension. In reserve.

Recorded the failure of Inextensible Comprehension at type e→t for the property of being even, sharpening the failure of Actuality; argument in the notes.

## Notes

The cited construction is a model of the map’s relational-type framework. The description identifies its evaluation point; construction and verification are given at the PDF locations in References.
ND, Actuality and Atomicity fail, Atomlessness holds, and Boolean Completeness fails as in part 2.
Countable Boolean Completeness fails as well, at type $e\to t$: the property $E$ that the source shows to lack a least upper bound has as its extension a countable family of haecceities, and the extensional fullness the source invokes to put $E$ in the domain also puts in the relation pairing the haecceity of the $k$-th member of that family with the numeral $k$, which injects $E$ into the numerals. So $\langle b,i\rangle\in Y\setminus B_{N^{\prime}}$, and $Y$ is not even weakly inextensible, so Weakly Inextensible Comprehension fails too. Observation of 23 September 2026, answering Cian Dorr’s question whether the failure of Actuality can be sharpened to a failure of Inextensible Comprehension. Observation of 23 September 2026, answering Cian Dorr’s question whether the failure of BF sharpens to type $t$. Boolean Completeness fails at type $t$ as well, which the source (n. 92) conjectures but does not show. Observation of Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 25 September 2026; not in the source.
