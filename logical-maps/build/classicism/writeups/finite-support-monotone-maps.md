## Package

- **Atomlessness.** Atomlessness in the displayed closed propositional formulation.
- **Rigid Power.** If a relation is rigid, so is the property of being a rigid relation that entails it.
- **Tame Rigidity.** Every weakly rigid relation, including a proposition, is rigid.
- **Axiom of Infinity (type e).** There are not finitely many individuals. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **Axiom of Infinity (type t).** There are not finitely many propositions. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **Infinity Schema (type e).** There are arbitrarily many pairwise distinct entities of this fixed type; one sentence for each positive integer n.
- **Infinity Schema (type t).** There are arbitrarily many pairwise distinct entities of this fixed type; one sentence for each positive integer n.
- **□Intensional Choice.** Every closed instance of Intensional Choice is necessary. Box the entire object-variable closure; retain the same type range and other schema side conditions.
- **No Pure Contingency.** Each closed sentence of the pure language, if true, is necessary. This is a sentence schema, not a quantifier over propositions.
- **Transversal Choice.** Every equivalence relation, at any type including e, has a transversal, that is, a property with exactly one instance in each of its cells.
- **¬ Witnessed Possibility.** For pure-formulas P with free variables among a finite tuple x, and distinct matching nonlogical constants c, a witness to P entails that P at those constants is possible.
- **¬ No Contingency (signature Σ).** Each closed sentence of the language of the fixed signature Sigma, if true, is necessary. A sentence schema, standing to No Pure Contingency as Possibility Maximalism (signature Σ) stands to Possibility Maximalism (pure).
- **¬ Distinctness-preserving collapse.** Every truth is necessary under the distinctness-preserving modality.
- **¬ Vicinity.** There is a true proposition that entails the possibility of each true proposition.
- **¬ BF.** The Barcan Formula at every type. The predicate formulation closes the formula schema using lambda abstraction.
- **¬ Boolean Completeness.** Every property of entities of a relational type has a greatest lower bound in that type.
- **¬ Countable Boolean Completeness.** Every countable property of entities of a relational type has a least upper bound in that type, where a property is countable when it injects into the natural numbers.
- **¬ Boolean Completeness (type t).** Boolean Completeness (type t) in the displayed closed propositional formulation.
- **¬ Weakly Inextensible Comprehension.** Every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a weakly inextensible one.
- **¬ BF (type t).** BF (type t) in the displayed closed propositional formulation.

## Definition

Proposition D.5, part 3 (p. 77): the one-object category whose arrows are all the monotone maps of $\mathbb N$. In every part, $W_0^\ddagger$ is the set of finite subsets of $\mathbb N$ and the model is ideally full: a proposition is a set of arrows whose membership depends only on the arrows’ values on some finite set of numbers (it is pinned down by that set), and an entity of a higher type is an applicative behaviour profile pinned down by a finite set in the same sense. The individuals are the natural numbers, acted on by the arrows themselves. Propositions and properties are thus about finitely many numbers and indifferent to how the arrows treat the rest. Evaluation point: the sole object, at the identity arrow.

Interpretation of Σ, fixed for this record: one designated relational constant $c$ of type $\tau=\bar\sigma t$ denotes $\lambda\bar x\, .\,p_0$, where $p_0$ is the proposition that the arrow fixes $0$, pinned down by $\{0\}$; every other constant of Σ is relational and denotes the top element of its type.

## Arguments

### Holds Atomlessness.

As in part 2.

*Source: Classicism, Proposition D.5(3), p. 77. By Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr, 2026-09-17.*

### Fails Witnessed Possibility, No Contingency (signature Σ).

No Contingency (signature Σ) fails, since $\forall\bar x\, .\,c\bar x$ denotes $p_0$, true and false at the constant map to $1$. Witnessed Possibility fails for the pure formula $x=\top_\tau$, witnessed by $\top_\tau$: $\Diamond(c=\top_\tau)$ is $\Diamond\Box p_0$, and $\Box p_0$ holds at no arrow $h$, since the constant map to $1$ composed after $h$ moves $0$. Separated Structure fails with it, being equivalent to Possibly Witnessed Possibility. Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ) fails by derivation, since Possibility Maximalism (pure) fails here. Whether $c$ denotes what some closed pure term denotes is not settled, so Independence (signature Σ) is left unknown. The choice of a contingent rather than a pure denotation is deliberate: this is the only recorded model of Atomlessness in which No Contingency (signature Σ) is refuted, the others being one-object models with pure interpretations of the constants.

*Address: `finite-support-monotone-maps#sigma-contingent`. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr’s request, 2026-09-22.*

*Revised 2026-09-23 by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic):* Re-fixed the interpretation of Σ so that the designated constant denotes a contingent proposition, refuting No Contingency (signature Σ) and settling the open question whether Atomlessness implies it; Independence (signature Σ) is no longer claimed for this model.

### Fails Distinctness-preserving collapse.

The shift $h$ that fixes $0,\ldots,m-1$ and adds one to everything from $m$ on is a monotone injection, so for any true $q$ pinned down by a finite $Y$ a monotone $k$ with $k(hy)=y$ on $Y$ exists and $k\circ h\in q$; thus $\Diamond q$ holds at $h$, while the true proposition that $m$ is fixed is false there.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-23.*

### Fails Vicinity.

A true $w$ pinned down by a finite set $S$ contains every arrow agreeing with the identity on $S$, among them the monotone map equal to the identity up to $M$ and constant at $M+1$ beyond it, for $S\subseteq[0,M]$, one that collapses two numbers $a\ne b$ outside $S$. The proposition $\{k : ka\ne kb\}$ (with the natural numbers as individuals, that $a$ and $b$ are distinct) is true, and it is possible at no arrow that collapses them, since a collapse persists under composition, so $w$ does not entail its possibility.

*By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's request, 2026-09-27.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The proposition that $a$ and $b$ are distinct is named as the set of arrows that keep them apart, so that the argument covers the variant with a single individual.

### Holds Rigid Power.

Write $X_0(E)$ for the intension $k\mapsto k\cdot E$. For $E$ pinned down uniformly by a finite $S_0$, $X_0(E)$ is in the domain, pinned down by $S_0$, and so is $X_0(T)$ for every $T\subseteq E$ and $X_0(k\cdot E)$ for every arrow $k$. The extension at $k$ of the power property $\lambda X\, .\,\operatorname{Rigid}(X)\land X\le F$ is the set of rigid $X$ with $X\le k\cdot F$, the bound variable untransported and the parameter transported; by the condition, for rigid $F=X_0(S)$ it is $\{X_0(T'):T'\subseteq k\cdot S\}$, and transporting the extension at the identity along $k$ gives $\{X_0(k\cdot T):T\subseteq S\}$, the same set, since $T'\subseteq k\cdot S$ is $k\cdot T$ for $T:=\{s\in S:k\cdot s\in T'\}$. So the power property is $X_0$ of its own extension, which is pinned down uniformly, hence in the domain and rigid. In these models the rigid relations are thus (a) the haecceities, (b) the properties "being pinned down by $S$", which are $X_0(\operatorname{Pin}(S))$, and (c) the disjunctions, finite or infinite, of haecceities of entities pinned down by one finite set; the boxed form follows from No Pure Contingency.

*From the group *Finite-support action models on one object*, shared argument `finite-support-one-object#rigid-power`. It requires that Every weakly rigid relation is the intension $k\mapsto k\cdot E$, the disjunction of the haecceities of the members of its extension $E$ at the identity, and $E$ is pinned down uniformly: some finite set pins down every member of $E$. Here: Let $Y$ be weakly rigid, pinned down by $S=[0,s]$, with extension $E$ at the identity. Pinning and weak persistence give $Y(k)\supseteq k_2\cdot E$ for every $k_2$ agreeing with $k$ on $S$, and weak inextensibility, tested on the intension $k\mapsto\bigcup\{k_2\cdot E:k_2\text{ agrees with }k\text{ on }N\}$, pinned down by $N$, gives the reverse inclusion; so $\bigcup\{k_2\cdot E:k_2\text{ agrees with }k\text{ on }N\}=Y(k)$ for every finite $N\supseteq S$. If some $p\in E$ were pinned minimally at $T$ with $t:=\max T>s$, take $s'\ge t$ and the jump map $k$, the identity on $[0,s']$ and adding $100$ beyond: an arrow agreeing with $k$ on $S$ and sending $t$ to $s'+1$ puts into the $S$-union an element pinned at $s'+1$, while every element of the $[0,s'+1]$-union is pinned inside $k([0,s'])\cup[s'+100,\infty)$. So $E\subseteq\operatorname{Pin}(S)$, and then $k_2\cdot p=k\cdot p$ whenever $k_2$ agrees with $k$ on $S$, so $Y(k)=k\cdot E$. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-04.*

### Holds Tame Rigidity.

By the condition a weakly rigid relation is $k\mapsto k\cdot E$, and it is in the domain; such an intension is rigid in any one-object model, by part (1) of the argument tame-rigidity. So every weakly rigid relation is rigid, and with No Pure Contingency the map's results give $\Box$Tame Rigidity.

*From the group *Finite-support action models on one object*, shared argument `finite-support-one-object#tame-rigidity-uniformly-pinned`. It requires that Every weakly rigid relation is the intension $k\mapsto k\cdot E$, the disjunction of the haecceities of the members of its extension $E$ at the identity, and $E$ is pinned down uniformly: some finite set pins down every member of $E$. Here: Let $Y$ be weakly rigid, pinned down by $S=[0,s]$, with extension $E$ at the identity. Pinning and weak persistence give $Y(k)\supseteq k_2\cdot E$ for every $k_2$ agreeing with $k$ on $S$, and weak inextensibility, tested on the intension $k\mapsto\bigcup\{k_2\cdot E:k_2\text{ agrees with }k\text{ on }N\}$, pinned down by $N$, gives the reverse inclusion; so $\bigcup\{k_2\cdot E:k_2\text{ agrees with }k\text{ on }N\}=Y(k)$ for every finite $N\supseteq S$. If some $p\in E$ were pinned minimally at $T$ with $t:=\max T>s$, take $s'\ge t$ and the jump map $k$, the identity on $[0,s']$ and adding $100$ beyond: an arrow agreeing with $k$ on $S$ and sending $t$ to $s'+1$ puts into the $S$-union an element pinned at $s'+1$, while every element of the $[0,s'+1]$-union is pinned inside $k([0,s'])\cup[s'+100,\infty)$. So $E\subseteq\operatorname{Pin}(S)$, and then $k_2\cdot p=k\cdot p$ whenever $k_2$ agrees with $k$ on $S$, so $Y(k)=k\cdot E$. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), on Cian Dorr's request to settle Tame Rigidity where it was open, 2026-10-09.*

### Holds Axiom of Infinity (type e).

The individuals are the natural numbers and identity at the evaluation arrow is literal, so no numeral counts them. The set of numerals at type $e$ is invariant under every arrow, hence has empty support and lies in the domain, so finite cardinality is standard and no finite cardinality holds of the universal property.

*From the group *Finite-support action models on one object*, shared argument `finite-support-one-object#axiom-of-infinity`. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-09-20.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Split from the argument for both types; the type-$t$ half, which does not need infinitely many individuals, is axiom-of-infinity-t.

### Holds Axiom of Infinity (type t).

The propositions that a given number is fixed by the arrow, one for each number, are pairwise distinct and each has that number as finite support, so there are infinitely many propositions. The set of numerals at type $t$ is invariant under every arrow, hence has empty support and lies in the domain, so finite cardinality is standard and no finite cardinality holds of the universal property.

*From the group *Finite-support action models on one object*, shared argument `finite-support-one-object#axiom-of-infinity-t`. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-09-20.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The type-$t$ half of the old argument, "individual" becoming "number", so that it covers the one-individual variants.

### Fails BF.

Witnessed by the qualitative property of being positive: an arrow sending $0$ to a positive number sends everything to positive numbers, so $\forall y\,\Box(Xz\to Xy)$ holds with $z:=0$ while $\Box\forall y(Xz\to Xy)$ fails.

*Source: Classicism, Proposition D.5, parts 3 and 4, pp. 77–78. From the group *Finite-support action models on one object*, shared argument `finite-support-one-object#barcan-positive`. It requires that Every arrow is monotone, and some arrow sends $0$ to a positive number. Here: Every arrow is monotone, and the constant map to $1$ sends $0$ to a positive number. By Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr, 2026-09-17.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The monotone maps' argument (part 3), which part 4 invokes with "as in part 3", stated once.

### Fails Boolean Completeness.

At type $e\to t$. In the source's terms an upper bound of the haecceities of the members of $A$ is a persistent property whose extension contains $A$. A least one, pinned down by $\{0,\ldots,n\}$, would be the strongest such property pinned down by $\{0,\ldots,n\}$, and would also lie below the strongest pinned down by $\{0,\ldots,m\}$ for each $m>n$, which by the condition is strictly stronger. So the haecceities have no least upper bound.

*Source: Classicism, Proposition D.5, parts 1–8, pp. 75–79. From the group *Finite-support action models on one object*, shared argument `finite-support-one-object#boolean-completeness`. It requires that For some set $A$ of individuals, the strongest persistent property whose extension contains $A$ and which is pinned down by $\{0,\ldots,n\}$ becomes strictly stronger as $n$ grows. Here: As in part 2, with $A$ the even numbers. By Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr, 2026-09-17.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Stated once for the group, with the step from "ever stronger" to the missing least upper bound spelled out; each member's strongest persistent properties moved to the condition unbounded-haecceities.

### Fails Countable Boolean Completeness.

At type $e\to t$: the property $E$ whose extension is the family of haecceities of the members of $A$, which has no least upper bound by the shared argument boolean-completeness, is countable, and the extensional fullness the source invokes to put $E$ in the domain also puts in the relation pairing the haecceity of the $k$-th member of $A$ with the numeral $k$, which injects $E$ into the numerals.

*From the group *Finite-support action models on one object*, shared argument `finite-support-one-object#countable-boolean-completeness`. It requires that For some set $A$ of individuals, the strongest persistent property whose extension contains $A$ and which is pinned down by $\{0,\ldots,n\}$ becomes strictly stronger as $n$ grows. Here: As in part 2, with $A$ the even numbers. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-23.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Now builds on the shared argument boolean-completeness instead of on each member's source argument; no change of substance.

### Fails Boolean Completeness (type t).

The source (n. 92) conjectures this but does not show it. Any set $F$ of propositions is the extension at the identity of an element of the domain at type $t\to t$, namely the profile $\langle h,p\rangle\mapsto\{i : i\cdot p\in F\}$: it is natural, independent of $h$ and so pinned down by the empty set, and each of its values is pinned down by the pinning set of $p$, since $i\cdot p$ depends only on the values of $i$ there. A least upper bound of $F$ under entailment is a least finitely pinned superset of $\bigcup F$, and it exists only if the least $S$-pinned superset of $\bigcup F$ stops shrinking as the finite set $S$ grows. So the family $F$ of the condition has no least upper bound, and, taking pointwise negations, the family of complements has no greatest lower bound.

*From the group *Finite-support action models on one object*, shared argument `finite-support-one-object#boolean-completeness-t`. It requires that Some family $F$ of propositions has no least finitely pinned superset of its union $\bigcup F$. Here: Let $F$ be the family of propositions $A_m$ ($m\ge1$), each pinned down by $\{0,2m-1,2m\}$, that the arrow is constant on $\{0,\ldots,2m-1\}$ and first changes value at $2m$. The least superset of $\bigcup F$ pinned down by $\{0,\ldots,N\}$ consists of the arrows whose first change of value is at an even position or beyond $N$, and it strictly shrinks as $N$ grows. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-25.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The seven members' copies stated once, each member's family moved to the condition no-least-pinned-cover; the truncations' separate argument of 23 September, by Claude Fable 5.1 prompted by Cian Dorr, is now its witness, its own proof that the family is in the domain giving way to the profile above. The trawl's second arguments for the same verdict (25 September, DeepSeek, reviewed by OpenAI Codex) were dropped.

### Fails Weakly Inextensible Comprehension.

At type $e\to t$, for the property of being even, which is in the domain as the constant intension $\{\langle b,h\rangle : b\text{ even}\}$, pinned down by $\emptyset$. Unpacking $\operatorname{Inextensible}$ as in the left-to-right half of Dorr’s rigidity criterion (draft, Lemma 14, p. 7, with Lemma 13): even the unboxed matrix, evaluated at the identity, says that $Y$ is contained in every persistent (transport-closed) $B$ in the domain whose extension includes $Y$’s. For a finite $N^{\prime}$, the smallest such $B$ pinned down by $N^{\prime}$ is $B_{N^{\prime}}:=\{\langle b^{\prime\prime},i^{\prime}\rangle : i^{\prime\prime}(b)=b^{\prime\prime}\text{ for some even }b\text{ and some arrow }i^{\prime\prime}\text{ agreeing with }i^{\prime}\text{ on }N^{\prime}\}$, which is transport-closed and pinned down by $N^{\prime}$. Now let $Y$ be coextensive with evenness and pinned down by a finite $N_0$; then $\langle b,i\rangle\in Y$ for every even $b$ and every arrow $i$ fixing $N_0$ pointwise. Take the arrow $i$, the even $b$ and the finite $N^{\prime}$ that the condition provides for $N_0$: no arrow agreeing with $i$ on $N^{\prime}$ sends an even number to $b$. So $\langle b,i\rangle\in Y\setminus B_{N^{\prime}}$, and $Y$ is not even weakly inextensible.

*From the group *Finite-support action models on one object*, shared argument `finite-support-one-object#weakly-inextensible-comprehension`. It requires that For every finite $N_0\subseteq\mathbb N$ there are an arrow $i$ fixing $N_0$ pointwise, an even $b$, and a finite $N^{\prime}$ such that no arrow agreeing with $i$ on $N^{\prime}$ sends an even number to $b$. Here: With $N_0\subseteq[0,M_0]$: $i$ the monotone map that is the identity on $[0,M_0]$ and adds one beyond it; an even $b>M_0+1$, whose only preimage under $i$ is the odd $b-1$; and $N^{\prime}:=[0,b]$: a monotone map agreeing with $i$ there has the same preimages of $b$ within $[0,b]$ and takes values at least $i(b)=b+1$ beyond it. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), answering Cian Dorr’s question whether the failure of Actuality can be sharpened to a failure of Inextensible Comprehension, 2026-09-23.*

*Revised 2026-09-25 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic):* Merged with the 25 September version; the argument already refutes the weak form, which was added.

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Stated once for the group, the witness moving to the condition evens-avoidable.

### Fails BF (type t).

In a one-object finitely pinned model, BF (type t) fails as soon as there are a finite $N$, an arrow $i$ and a proposition $q$ in the domain that is the transport $i^{\prime}\cdot p=\{k : k\circ i^{\prime}\in p\}$ of no proposition $p$ along any arrow $i^{\prime}$ agreeing with $i$ on $N$: the intension $X:=\{\langle r,j\rangle : r\ne q\text{ or }j\text{ disagrees with }i\text{ on }N\}$, which the condition puts in the domain, contains $\langle i^{\prime}\cdot p,i^{\prime}\rangle$ for every $p$ and $i^{\prime}$, so $\forall p\, .\,\Box Xp$ holds at the identity, and omits $\langle q,i\rangle$, so $\Box\forall p\, .\,Xp$ fails there. Since membership of $k$ in $i^{\prime}\cdot p$ depends only on $k$ restricted to the range of $i^{\prime}$, it suffices that $q$ separate two arrows agreeing on every such range, as the condition provides.

*General argument `arguments/barcan-t-transport`. It requires that The model is a one-object action model whose entities are finitely pinned, and there are a finite set $N$, an arrow $i$ and a proposition $q$ in the domain such that $q$ separates two arrows that agree on the range of every arrow agreeing with $i$ on $N$, and the intension $\{\langle r,j\rangle : r\ne q\text{ or }j\text{ disagrees with }i\text{ on }N\}$ is in the domain. Here: Take $N=\{0\}$, $i$ any monotone map with $i0=2$, so that every $i^{\prime}$ agreeing with it on $N$ has range within $[2,\infty)$, and $q:=\{k : k1=1\}$, pinned down by $\{1\}$: two monotone maps agreeing on $[2,\infty)$ with $k2\ge1$ may take the values $1$ and $0$ at $1$. The model is a one-object finite-support model, and the intension the argument uses is pinned down by $N$. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), answering Cian Dorr’s question whether the failure of BF sharpens to type $t$, 2026-09-23.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The finite-support group's argument and the symmetric range-gap models' copies stated once for the topic; that $X$ is in the domain (pinned down by $N$, and in a symmetric model symmetric) is now part of each record's reason for meeting transport-gap.

### Holds Axiom of Infinity (type e), Infinity Schema (type e).

The Infinity schema holds, there being $n$ distinct individuals for every $n$. For the Axiom: by extensional fullness the domain has a property of cardinalities true of $Z$ exactly when every property $Z$ holds of has a finite extension. It holds of $\mathbf{0}_e$, which holds only of empty properties, and passes from $Y$ to $\operatorname{Suc}_e Y$, which holds of $F$ only if $Y$ holds of $F$ less one of its instances. So every finite cardinality has it, and none holds of the universal property, whose extension is infinite.

*General argument `arguments/infinitely-many-individuals`. It requires that The model is extensionally full at every object: every set of tuples from the domains at an object is the extension, at the identity arrow, of an element of the domain of the matching relational type there. Here: The model is ideally full, hence extensionally full at every object (Appendix D, the remark after Definition D.3): for any set $R$ of tuples from the domains at an object $V$, the intension that assigns to every arrow out of $V$ into an object $U$ a fixed set $R_U$ of tuples from $U$’s domains, with $R_V=R$, is pinned down by $\emptyset$, so it is the intension of an element of $V^{\bar\sigma\to t}$ with extension $R$ at $1_V$. It requires that There are infinitely many individuals at the evaluation world. Here: The individuals are the natural numbers. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Holds Axiom of Infinity (type t), Infinity Schema (type t).

As for individuals (the argument infinitely-many-individuals), at type $t$: the Infinity schema holds, and by extensional fullness the property of cardinalities that hold only of properties with finite extensions is in the domain, has every finite cardinality, and excludes those holding of the universal property of propositions, whose extension is infinite.

*General argument `arguments/infinitely-many-propositions`. It requires that The model is extensionally full at every object: every set of tuples from the domains at an object is the extension, at the identity arrow, of an element of the domain of the matching relational type there. Here: The model is ideally full, hence extensionally full at every object (Appendix D, the remark after Definition D.3): for any set $R$ of tuples from the domains at an object $V$, the intension that assigns to every arrow out of $V$ into an object $U$ a fixed set $R_U$ of tuples from $U$’s domains, with $R_V=R$, is pinned down by $\emptyset$, so it is the intension of an element of $V^{\bar\sigma\to t}$ with extension $R$ at $1_V$. It requires that There are infinitely many propositions at the evaluation world. Here: The propositions that a given number is fixed by the arrow, one for each number, are pairwise distinct, each pinned down by that number (the shared argument axiom-of-infinity-t). By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Holds □Intensional Choice.

For each object $U$ and type $\sigma$ fix a well-ordering $<_U$ of the domain $D^\sigma_U$, and let $W$ be the intension of type $\sigma\to\sigma\to t$ with $W(h):={<_{\operatorname{cod}h}}$. Its value depends only on the arrow's codomain, so by the condition it is in the domain, and at every world its extension well-orders that world's type-$\sigma$ domain. Given $F$ with $\Box\exists x\, .\,Fx$, put $G:=\lambda x\, .\,Fx\land\forall y\, .\,(Fy\to\neg Wyx)$, the $W$-least $F$. It is definable from $F$ and $W$, so in the domain; $G\le F$, and its extension at every arrow is the singleton of the least element of $F$'s. So Intensional Choice holds, and the same at every reachable object gives $\Box$Intensional Choice. Cian Dorr's observation that such models are qualitatively full, made precise.

*General argument `arguments/intensional-choice-well-ordering`. It requires that At every object reachable from the evaluation point, the domain contains every intension whose value at an arrow depends only on the arrow's codomain. Here: With one object such an intension is constant, so it is pinned down by $\emptyset$, and the domain holds every finitely pinned intension. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's suggestion, 2026-10-03.*

### Holds No Pure Contingency.

Closed pure terms denote entities fixed by every arrow (§3.5, p. 58). With a single object, a proposition fixed by every arrow contains every arrow if it contains the identity and no arrow otherwise, so a true closed pure sentence is necessary: the source's one-object No Pure Contingency observation (p. 79), applied to each closed instance.

*Source: Classicism, §3.5, p. 58; p. 79. General argument `arguments/no-pure-contingency-one-object`. It requires that The model is an action model (Classicism, Appendix D), or an intensional action model in the sense of Dorr's draft (Boolean Completeness does not imply Rigid Comprehension), with a single object. Here: Each part of Proposition D.5 is a one-object category acting on $\mathbb N$ (Appendix D, Definitions D.1–D.3). By Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr, 2026-09-17.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Moved from the group finite-support-one-object to the topic, for every one-object action model; the reason the source's observation holds is spelled out in place of "Boxed positive flags use the source’s explicit one-object No Pure Contingency observation, applied separately to each closed instance."

### Holds Transversal Choice.

For an equivalence relation at the evaluation point, a transversal of its extension there, chosen in the metatheory, is by extensional fullness the extension of an element of the domain; the equivalence and transversal conditions are unboxed.

*General argument `arguments/transversal-choice-extensionally-full`. It requires that The model is extensionally full at every object: every set of tuples from the domains at an object is the extension, at the identity arrow, of an element of the domain of the matching relational type there. Here: The model is ideally full, hence extensionally full at every object (Appendix D, the remark after Definition D.3): for any set $R$ of tuples from the domains at an object $V$, the intension that assigns to every arrow out of $V$ into an object $U$ a fixed set $R_U$ of tuples from $U$’s domains, with $R_V=R$, is pinned down by $\emptyset$, so it is the intension of an element of $V^{\bar\sigma\to t}$ with extension $R$ at $1_V$. By Cian Dorr (observation); recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), on a question of Zachary Goodsell, after an observation of Christopher Sun, 2026-09-25.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The Relational Choice and Transversal Choice arguments merged into one, stated for every extensionally full model.

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Moved from the group finite-support-one-object to the topic. Its first sentence, deriving extensional fullness from ideal fullness, is now the group's reason for meeting extensionally-full.


## Notes

The cited construction is a model of the map’s relational-type framework. The description identifies its evaluation point; construction and verification are given at the PDF locations in References. The source notes that with all maps BF would still hold, since every map agrees on any finite set with a surjection; monotonicity is what makes it fail.

## History

The record's revision log before it was written as arguments.

- **2026-09-27** (Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's request) — Recorded the failure of Vicinity; argument in the notes. Now violates: Vicinity.
- **2026-09-25** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added Transversal Choice, by the argument recorded for Relational Choice: the model is extensionally full at every object, so for an equivalence relation at the evaluation point a transversal of its extension there, chosen in the metatheory, is the extension of an element pinned down by the empty set; the equivalence and transversal conditions are unboxed. Recorded on a question of Zachary Goodsell, after an observation of Christopher Sun. Now satisfies: Transversal Choice.
- **2026-09-25** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added the failure of BF (type t), of Boolean Completeness (type t) and of Inextensible Comprehension, with the arguments in the notes. Now violates: BF (type t), Boolean Completeness (type t), Inextensible Comprehension.
- **2026-09-25** (Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic)) — Merged the two sets of arguments recorded on 23 and 25 September into one, keeping the 23 September arguments for Inextensible Comprehension and BF (type t); the former already refutes the weak form. Now violates: Weakly Inextensible Comprehension.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Expanded the description from Appendix D, naming Proposition D.5 and its part; added the failure of Countable Boolean Completeness at type e→t; settled the Distinctness-preserving collapse. Now violates: Countable Boolean Completeness, Distinctness-preserving collapse.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Re-fixed the interpretation of Σ so that the designated constant denotes a contingent proposition, refuting No Contingency (signature Σ) and settling the open question whether Atomlessness implies it; Independence (signature Σ) is no longer claimed for this model. Now violates: No Contingency (signature Σ).
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added Relational Choice and its necessitation at Cian Dorr’s direction: ideally full models are extensionally full at every object, and choice in the metatheory supplies the functional subrelation; see the notes. Now satisfies: Relational Choice, □Relational Choice.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Recorded the failure of Inextensible Comprehension at type e→t for the property of being even, sharpening the failure of Actuality; argument in the notes. Now violates: Inextensible Comprehension.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Recorded the failure of BF at type t, sharpening the failure of BF; argument in the notes. Now violates: BF (type t).
- **2026-09-22** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Fixed an interpretation of Σ (relational constants as top, individual constants as one fixed individual) and recorded the signature schemata it refutes, at Cian Dorr’s request. Now violates: Witnessed Possibility, Separated Structure, Maximalism (signature Σ).
- **2026-09-20** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added both Axioms of Infinity at Cian Dorr's direction. The individuals are the natural numbers and identity at the evaluation arrow is literal, so no numeral counts them. The propositions that a given individual is fixed by the arrow, one for each individual, are pairwise distinct and each has that individual as finite support, so there are infinitely many propositions. The set of numerals at each type is invariant under every arrow, hence has empty support and lies in the domain, so finite cardinality is standard and no finite cardinality holds of the universal property at either type. Now satisfies: Axiom of Infinity (type e), Axiom of Infinity (type t).
- **2026-09-17** (OpenAI Codex (GPT-6)) — Adopted the source’s relational type system at the user’s request. The cited construction now directly supplies the recorded model; the former type-extension obligation is removed. Now satisfies: No Pure Contingency, Atomlessness. Now violates: ND, Atomicity, Actuality, BF, Boolean Completeness, Rigid Comprehension.
