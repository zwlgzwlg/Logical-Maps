## Premises

- **Gallin Extensional Comprehension.** Every relation is coextensive with one that is persistent and has a persistent pointwise negation. This is the source’s comparison with Gallin’s different rigidity convention.

## Conclusion

- **ND.** Distinct things of any type are necessarily distinct.

## Proof

Fix a type $\sigma$ and $a,b^\sigma$ with $a\ne b$, and apply Gallin Extensional Comprehension to $\lambda x^\sigma\, .\,x=a$, whose type $\sigma t$ is admitted at every $\sigma$. Let $Y$ be the coextension supplied, with $Y$ and $\neg Y$ both persistent. Since $a=a$, coextensiveness gives $Ya$, and persistence of $Y$ gives $\Box Ya$. Since $b\ne a$, coextensiveness gives $\neg Yb$, and persistence of $\neg Y$ gives $\Box\neg Yb$. So $\Box(Ya\land\neg Yb)$. By Leibniz's law $a=b$ would make $Ya$ and $Yb$ agree, so $Ya\land\neg Yb$ entails $a\ne b$; that entailment is a theorem, so it necessitates and $\Box(a\ne b)$ follows. The type $\sigma$ was arbitrary, which is the whole schema.

## Notes

Only persistence of the coextension and of its pointwise negation is used, and only at the actual world, so no modal axiom beyond the background is needed. Persistence alone would not do. What forces the necessary distinctness is that the negation is persistent too, which pins the non-instances down as firmly as the instances.
