# Strong Leibniz Biconditionals ⇒ Atomicity

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Philosophical Introduction to HOL (2024), Lean `Classicism.Map.strong_leibniz_r_implies_atomicity_r`; produced by Andrew Bacon; recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 22 September 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **Strong Leibniz Biconditionals.** At each relational type, every possible entity (one distinct from bottom) is entailed by a strong world: a possible entity that necessarily entails every entity of the type or its negation. The right-to-left direction is a theorem of C; the principle records the substantive direction.

## Conclusion

- **Atomicity.** Every non-bottom entity of each relational type has an atom below it.

## Proof

A strong world is a weak world: $\operatorname{SWorld}_\sigma(W)$ has the conjunct $\Box\forall Y\, .\,W\le Y\lor W\le\neg Y$, and T gives $\forall Y\, .\,W\le Y\lor W\le\neg Y$. So a strong world below a possible $X$ is an atom below it; and a non-bottom $X$ is possible in the sense $X\ne\bot_\sigma$, which is how Atomicity’s antecedent reads.

## Notes

The map’s Atomicity is stated with the predicate Atom, which coincides with WWorld: a non-bottom entity every non-bottom part of which is itself, equivalently one that settles every entity of the type.
