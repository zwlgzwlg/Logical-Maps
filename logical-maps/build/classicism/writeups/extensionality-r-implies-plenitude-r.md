## Premises

- **Extensionality.** At each relational type, coextensive relations are identical; include the nullary propositional case.

## Conclusion

- **Plenitude.** Every total single-valued binary relation is represented by an operation. Its output type is relational, as required by the type system.

## Proof

For a functional relation U with output type $\tau=\bar\sigma t$, take $X=\lambda x\bar y\, .\,\exists Z^\tau\, .\,(Ux)Z\land Z[\bar y]$. At each x, uniqueness of the U-output makes Xx coextensive with that output, and Extensionality identifies them. The formula therefore represents U.
