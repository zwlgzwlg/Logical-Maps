# □ND ∧ Persistent Comprehension ⇒ Gallin Extensional Comprehension

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Misc., Lean `Classicism.Map.c5_and_persistent_comprehension_imply_gallin`; produced by Claude Opus 5 (Anthropic), 20 September 2026, from a suggestion of Cian Dorr; recorded by Claude Opus 5 (Anthropic), 20 September 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **□ND.** Necessarily, distinct things of any type are necessarily distinct.
- **Persistent Comprehension.** Every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a persistent one.

## Conclusion

- **Gallin Extensional Comprehension.** Every relation is coextensive with one that is persistent and has a persistent pointwise negation. This is the source’s comparison with Gallin’s different rigidity convention.

## Proof

Let $X$ be given and let $Y$ be a persistent coextension, which Persistent Comprehension supplies. Only persistence of $Y$ is used. What has to be added is that $\neg Y$ is persistent, which is the necessitation of a pointwise implication, so the argument must run at every world; that is what the boxed premise supplies. At any world, take $\bar x$ with $\neg Y[\bar x]$ and suppose $\Diamond Y[\bar x]$. Persistence of $Y$ is itself necessary, so $\Diamond Y[\bar x]$ yields $\Diamond\Box Y[\bar x]$. Boxed ND gives B at every world, and B in the form $\Diamond\Box p\to p$ then yields $Y[\bar x]$, against the assumption. So $\Box\neg Y[\bar x]$, which is persistence of $\neg Y$. Hence $Y$ is Gallin-extensional and coextensive with $X$.

## Notes

Rigid Comprehension implies Persistent Comprehension, so this covers the reading on which rigidity yields Gallin-extensionality. The boxed form of ND is needed rather than the plain form, because persistence of the negation is itself a boxed claim and the argument has to be available at every world. In the other direction the draft's note uses BF, which is doing separate work: it stops a world from having instances that the base world does not supply, and no amount of ND replaces it.
