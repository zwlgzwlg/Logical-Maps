# Witnessed Possibility ∧ No Pure Contingency ⇒ Possibly Witnessed Possibility

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Misc., Lean `Classicism.Map.witnessed_possibility_and_npc_imply_possibly_witnessed_possibility`; produced by Cian Dorr, suggestion of 22 September 2026; proof written out by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 22 September 2026; recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 22 September 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **Witnessed Possibility.** For pure-formulas P with free variables among a finite tuple x, and distinct matching nonlogical constants c, a witness to P entails that P at those constants is possible.
- **No Pure Contingency.** Each closed sentence of the pure language, if true, is necessary. This is a sentence schema, not a quantifier over propositions.

## Conclusion

- **Possibly Witnessed Possibility.** For pure formulas P with free variables among a finite tuple x and distinct matching constants c, a possible witness to P entails that P at those constants is possible. Equivalently, P necessary at the constants is necessary universally.

## Proof

$\neg\exists\bar x\, .\,P$ is a closed pure sentence, so No Pure Contingency gives $\neg\exists\bar x\, .\,P\to\Box\neg\exists\bar x\, .\,P$; contraposing, $\Diamond\exists\bar x\, .\,P\to\exists\bar x\, .\,P$. Witnessed Possibility then gives $\Diamond P[\bar c/\bar x]$.

## Notes

Together with the other records this yields Logical Necessity ⇔ Separated Structure + No Pure Contingency, the observation Classicism makes in a footnote that did not survive into the published version.
