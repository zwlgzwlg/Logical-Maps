<p class='cert'>Model — Source: Classicism (2024); produced by Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr; recorded by OpenAI Codex (GPT-6), 17 September 2026.</p>

## Package

- **□Rigid Comprehension.** Necessarily, every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a rigid one.
- **□Atomicity.** Necessarily, every non-bottom entity of each relational type has an atom below it.
- **ND (type t).** ND (type t) in the displayed closed propositional formulation.
- **Gallin Extensional Comprehension.** Every relation is coextensive with one that is persistent and has a persistent pointwise negation. This is the source’s comparison with Gallin’s different rigidity convention.
- **□Intensional Choice.** Every closed instance of Intensional Choice is necessary. Box the entire object-variable closure; retain the same type range and other schema side conditions.
- **□Relational Choice.** Necessarily, every serial binary relation has a functional subrelation.
- **Relational Choice.** Every serial binary relation has a functional subrelation.
- **Countable Boolean Completeness.** Every countable property of entities of a relational type has a least upper bound in that type, where a property is countable when it injects into the natural numbers.
- **Transversal Choice.** Every equivalence relation, at any type including e, has a transversal, that is, a property with exactly one instance in each of its cells.
- **¬ No Pure Contingency.** Each closed sentence of the pure language, if true, is necessary. This is a sentence schema, not a quantifier over propositions.
- **¬ Strong Leibniz Biconditionals (type t).** The type-t instance of the Strong Leibniz Biconditionals: every possible proposition is entailed by a strong world proposition, one that is possible and necessarily entails every proposition or its negation.
- **¬ Infinity Schema (type t).** There are arbitrarily many pairwise distinct entities of this fixed type; one sentence for each positive integer n.
- **¬ Possible Infinity (type t).** Possibly there are not finitely many propositions: the Axiom of Infinity at this type, under a diamond.
- **¬ Axiom of Infinity (type e).** There are not finitely many individuals. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **¬ Infinity Schema (type e).** There are arbitrarily many pairwise distinct entities of this fixed type; one sentence for each positive integer n.
- **¬ Possible Infinity (type e).** Possibly there are not finitely many individuals: the Axiom of Infinity at this type, under a diamond.
- **¬ No Contingency (signature Σ).** Each closed sentence of the language of the fixed signature Sigma, if true, is necessary. A sentence schema, standing to No Pure Contingency as Possibility Maximalism (signature Σ) stands to Possibility Maximalism (pure).
- **¬ Witnessed Possibility.** For pure-formulas P with free variables among a finite tuple x, and distinct matching nonlogical constants c, a witness to P entails that P at those constants is possible.
- **¬ Separated Structure.** For each typed nonlogical constant c and closed same-typed terms F,G not containing c, equality after application to c implies equality of F and G.
- **¬ Independence (signature Σ).** No constant of Sigma is a pure operation applied to other constants: for a closed pure term A and distinct constants c, d_1,…,d_n with n ≥ 0, c differs from A applied to the d’s. With n = 0, no constant denotes a pure entity.
- **¬ Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ).** The Distinctness Maximalism schema for the fixed nonlogical signature Sigma.

## Definition

Use the source’s category with h:W0→W1, j:W1→W0 and k:W1→W1, evaluated at W0.

Individuals, fixed for this record: there is a single individual at every object, and every arrow sends it to the single individual at its target.

Interpretation of Σ, fixed for this record: one designated relational constant $c$ of type $\tau=\bar\sigma t$ denotes $\lambda\bar x\, .\,a$, where $a$ is the unique true atom of the model, the actual-world proposition $\{1\}$; every other constant of Σ, of which there is at least one, is relational and denotes the top element of its type.

*A member of the group Full action models, which supplies this definition with the record's settings, and the arguments marked as shared.*

## Arguments

### Holds □Rigid Comprehension, □Atomicity.

*Source: Classicism, §3.5, p. 59, fifth paragraph and n. 81. By Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr, 2026-09-17.*

### Holds ND (type t). Fails No Pure Contingency.

ND at t holds there and fails at W1.

*Source: Classicism, §3.5, p. 59, fifth paragraph and n. 81. By Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr, 2026-09-17.*

### Fails Strong Leibniz Biconditionals (type t).

The possible proposition $\{h\}$ has only itself as a candidate strong world below it, but under $h$ it becomes $\{x : x\circ h=h\}=\{\mathrm{id}_{W_1},k\}$, which the proposition $\{\mathrm{id}_{W_1}\}$ of $W_1$’s full domain separates, so $\{h\}$ does not necessarily settle every proposition. Since Atomicity holds in this full model, this shows that Atomicity (type t) alone does not yield the type-t Strong Leibniz Biconditionals; BF (type t) fails here, $h$ acting non-surjectively from a four-element to an eight-element domain.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-22.*

### Holds Gallin Extensional Comprehension.

Since $j\circ h=1_{W_0}$, every arrow out of $W_0$ acts injectively at every type (a left inverse exists), and the equivalence relation on pairs (arrow $g$ out of $W_0$, tuple at its target) generated by $(g,\bar b)\sim(x\circ g,x\cdot\bar b)$ has as its classes the sets $\{(1_{W_0},\bar a)\}\cup\{(h,\bar b) : j\cdot\bar b=\bar a\}$, one for each tuple $\bar a$ at $W_0$, using $k\circ h=h$ and $j\circ k=j$. Given $X$ with extension $E$ at $W_0$, let $Y$ hold at $(g,\bar b)$ iff that pair lies in the class of some $(1_{W_0},\bar a)$ with $\bar a\in E$; $Y$ is a natural intension, so in the full model, it is coextensive with $X$ at $W_0$, and both $Y$ and its negation take only the values $\top$ and $\bot$, so both are persistent. The boxed form fails, as recorded, since ND fails at $W_1$.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-25.*

### Fails Infinity Schema (type t), Possible Infinity (type t).

$W_0$ has exactly four propositions with literal identity, so there are no five pairwise distinct ones; Possible Infinity (type $t$) fails as well, since $W_1$ has eight.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-25.*

### Holds □Intensional Choice.

For each object $U$ and type $\sigma$ fix a well-ordering $<_U$ of the domain $D^\sigma_U$, and let $W$ be the intension of type $\sigma\to\sigma\to t$ with $W(h):={<_{\operatorname{cod}h}}$. Its value depends only on the arrow's codomain, so by the condition it is in the domain, and at every world its extension well-orders that world's type-$\sigma$ domain. Given $F$ with $\Box\exists x\, .\,Fx$, put $G:=\lambda x\, .\,Fx\land\forall y\, .\,(Fy\to\neg Wyx)$, the $W$-least $F$. It is definable from $F$ and $W$, so in the domain; $G\le F$, and its extension at every arrow is the singleton of the least element of $F$'s. So Intensional Choice holds, and the same at every reachable object gives $\Box$Intensional Choice. Cian Dorr's observation that such models are qualitatively full, made precise.

*General argument `arguments/intensional-choice-well-ordering`. It requires that At every object reachable from the evaluation point, the domain contains every intension whose value at an arrow depends only on the arrow's codomain. Here: The domains are full at every object. It requires that The model is constructed in a metatheory with the axiom of choice. Here: The constructions are carried out in ZFC. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's suggestion, 2026-10-03.*

### Fails Axiom of Infinity (type e), Infinity Schema (type e), Possible Infinity (type e).

No two individuals are distinct, and the numeral $\operatorname{Suc}_e\mathbf{0}_e$ holds of the universal property at type $e$ at every world.

*General argument `arguments/one-individual`. It requires that There is exactly one individual, at every world. Here: There is a single individual at every object. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-02.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Moved from the group finite-support-one-object to the topic.

### Holds □Relational Choice.

The truncation of a full action model at any arrow is again a full action model, its domains at the reachable objects being unchanged, and Relational Choice holds in every full model given choice in the metatheory (Classicism, p. 61).

*General argument `arguments/relational-choice-full-boxed`. It requires that The model is a full action model: an action model (Classicism, Appendix D) that is full at every object. Here: An action model, full at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59; Appendix D). It requires that The model is constructed in a metatheory with the axiom of choice. Here: The constructions are carried out in ZFC. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-22.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The two-object full action models' copies stated once for the topic, for every full action model.

### Holds Relational Choice.

With choice in the metatheory a serial relation has a functional subrelation, and a full model contains every intension, so that subrelation is in the domain; see Classicism, p. 61, on the principles common to full models.

*General argument `arguments/relational-choice-full`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that The model is constructed in a metatheory with the axiom of choice. Here: The constructions are carried out in ZFC. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-09-20.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The full action models' copies stated once for the topic.

### Fails No Contingency (signature Σ), Witnessed Possibility, Separated Structure, Independence (signature Σ), Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ).

No Contingency (signature Σ) fails, since the Σ-sentence $\forall\bar x\, .\,c\bar x$ denotes $a$, true and contingent; Witnessed Possibility fails for the pure formula $x=\top_\tau$, witnessed by $\top_\tau$, since $\Diamond(c=\top_\tau)$ is $\Diamond\Box a$ and $a$ is necessary at no world; Separated Structure fails with it, being equivalent to Possibly Witnessed Possibility; Independence (signature Σ) and Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ) fail through the other relational constants: such a constant $c'$ of type $\tau'$ denotes what the closed pure term $\top_{\tau'}$ denotes, and $c'=\top_{\tau'}$ is a true identity that C(Σ) does not prove. The designated constant refutes neither: closed pure terms denote entities fixed by every arrow (Classicism, §3.5, p. 58), whereas some arrow does not fix $a$, so no closed pure term denotes $\lambda\bar x\, .\,a$.

*General argument `arguments/sigma-true-atom`. It requires that Σ has a designated relational constant $c$ of type $\tau=\bar\sigma t$ denoting $\lambda\bar x\, .\,a$, where $a$ is the actual-world proposition, the unique true atom; every other constant, of which there is at least one, is relational and denotes the top element of its type. Here: This is the interpretation. It requires that The actual-world proposition $a$, the strongest truth, is in the domain; it is necessary at no world, and some arrow does not fix it. Here: The singleton $a$ of the identity arrow is in the domain, the model being full. It is necessary at no world: a world other than the identity sees itself, which lies outside $a$, and the identity sees an arrow other than itself. And a non-identity arrow $k$ does not fix it, since $1\in k\cdot a$ would need $1\circ k=1$. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr’s request, 2026-09-22.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The verbatim copies in ten records (finite-support, symmetric and full action models) stated once for the topic. Its B clause is now sigma-true-atom-b, which needs an arrow from which the actual world is out of reach. "$a$ is fixed by no arrow but the identity" became "some arrow does not fix $a$": in a symmetric model the actual-world proposition is the symmetry group, which its members fix, and the conclusion needs only the weaker claim.

### Holds Countable Boolean Completeness.

The natural numbers are the finite cardinalities at type $e$ (Background, after Goodsell), and with a single individual there are three: $\mathbf{0}_e$, true of the empty property; $\operatorname{Suc}_e\mathbf{0}_e$, true of the universal one; and the empty cardinality, which is $\operatorname{Suc}_e$ of the second and of itself. By extensional fullness the property of being one of these three is in the domain, so it bounds natural numberhood. A countable property therefore has at most three members in its extension, and their join is its least upper bound.

*General argument `arguments/three-numbers`. It requires that There is exactly one individual, at every world. Here: There is a single individual at every object. It requires that The model is extensionally full at every object: every set of tuples from the domains at an object is the extension, at the identity arrow, of an element of the domain of the matching relational type there. Here: A full model contains every intension, so in particular one with any given extension at the identity. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), on Cian Dorr's question whether the failure of Boolean Completeness at type $t$ refutes its countable form here, 2026-10-02.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Moved from the group finite-support-one-object to the topic.

### Holds Transversal Choice.

For an equivalence relation at the evaluation point, a transversal of its extension there, chosen in the metatheory, is by extensional fullness the extension of an element of the domain; the equivalence and transversal conditions are unboxed.

*General argument `arguments/transversal-choice-extensionally-full`. It requires that The model is extensionally full at every object: every set of tuples from the domains at an object is the extension, at the identity arrow, of an element of the domain of the matching relational type there. Here: A full model contains every intension, so in particular one with any given extension at the identity. It requires that The model is constructed in a metatheory with the axiom of choice. Here: The constructions are carried out in ZFC. By Cian Dorr (observation); recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), on a question of Zachary Goodsell, after an observation of Christopher Sun, 2026-09-25.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The Relational Choice and Transversal Choice arguments merged into one, stated for every extensionally full model.

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Moved from the group finite-support-one-object to the topic. Its first sentence, deriving extensional fullness from ideal fullness, is now the group's reason for meeting extensionally-full.


## Notes

The cited construction is a model of the map’s relational-type framework. The description identifies its evaluation point; construction and verification are given at the PDF locations in References. Only the type-t ND assertion is recorded. Everything that implies these fails with them.
