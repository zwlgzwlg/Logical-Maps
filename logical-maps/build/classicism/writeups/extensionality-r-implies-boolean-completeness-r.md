# Extensionality ⇒ Boolean Completeness

## Premises

- **Extensionality.** At each relational type, coextensive relations are identical; include the nullary propositional case.

## Conclusion

- **Boolean Completeness.** Every property of entities of a relational type has a greatest lower bound in that type.

## Proof

For a property X of relations, put $U=\lambda\bar z\, .\,\forall Z\, .\,XZ\to Z[\bar z]$. When XV holds, the Fregean Axiom makes XV necessary and the displayed universal sentence entails $V[\bar z]$; Extensionality gives $U\le V$. Conversely, any lower bound Y pointwise entails the displayed defining condition for U, so Extensionality gives $Y\le U$. Thus U is a GLB.
