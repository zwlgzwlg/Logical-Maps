## Package

- **BF.** The Barcan Formula at every type. The predicate formulation closes the formula schema using lambda abstraction.
- **Axiom of Infinity (type e).** There are not finitely many individuals. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **Axiom of Infinity (type t).** There are not finitely many propositions. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **□Relational Choice.** Necessarily, every serial binary relation has a functional subrelation.
- **Necessity of Arithmetic.** Every arithmetical sentence is either necessarily true or necessarily false, given that possibly zero is not a successor and successor is injective on numbers. One sentence for each arithmetical sentence.
- **B for sentences of Σ.** The B instance for every closed sentence of the language of the fixed signature Sigma.
- **□Intensional Choice.** Every closed instance of Intensional Choice is necessary. Box the entire object-variable closure; retain the same type range and other schema side conditions.
- **Transversal Choice.** Every equivalence relation, at any type including e, has a transversal, that is, a property with exactly one instance in each of its cells.
- **¬ □BF.** Necessarily, the Barcan Formula holds at every type. The predicate formulation closes the formula schema using lambda abstraction.
- **¬ Atomlessness.** Atomlessness in the displayed closed propositional formulation.
- **¬ Distinctness-preserving collapse.** Every truth is necessary under the distinctness-preserving modality.
- **¬ Boolean Completeness (type t).** Boolean Completeness (type t) in the displayed closed propositional formulation.
- **¬ Countable Boolean Completeness.** Every countable property of entities of a relational type has a least upper bound in that type, where a property is countable when it injects into the natural numbers.
- **¬ □BF (type t).** Necessarily, BF (type t) holds, in the displayed closed propositional formulation.
- **¬ Inextensible Comprehension.** Every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a inextensible one.
- **¬ Vicinity.** There is a true proposition that entails the possibility of each true proposition.
- **¬ Weakly Inextensible Comprehension.** Every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a weakly inextensible one.
- **¬ Witnessed Possibility.** For pure-formulas P with free variables among a finite tuple x, and distinct matching nonlogical constants c, a witness to P entails that P at those constants is possible.
- **¬ Separated Structure.** For each typed nonlogical constant c and closed same-typed terms F,G not containing c, equality after application to c implies equality of F and G.
- **¬ Independence (signature Σ).** No constant of Sigma is a pure operation applied to other constants: for a closed pure term A and distinct constants c, d_1,…,d_n with n ≥ 0, c differs from A applied to the d’s. With n = 0, no constant denotes a pure entity.
- **¬ Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ).** The Distinctness Maximalism schema for the fixed nonlogical signature Sigma.

## Definition

Appendix D, p. 79, the paragraph beginning “One particularly interesting result”: two objects, $W_0=\mathbb N$ and $W_1=\{0\}$, with all functions between them as arrows, $W_i^\ddagger$ the finite subsets of $W_i$, and the model ideally full as in Proposition D.5. Evaluation point: $W_0$, at its identity arrow.

Interpretation of Σ, fixed for this record: every constant of Σ is relational, and each denotes the top element of its type.

## Arguments

### Holds BF. Fails □BF.

BF holds at $W_0$, since every map agrees on any finite set with a surjection, and fails at $W_1$, where $\forall y\,\Box\,x=y$ holds of the one individual but $\Box\forall y\,x=y$ does not; so BF holds without $\Box$BF.

*Source: Classicism, p. 79. By Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr, 2026-09-17.*

### Fails Atomlessness.

The closed sentence that there is exactly one individual denotes the singleton of the unique map to $W_1$, a nonempty proposition with no nonempty proper subproposition.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-19.*

### Holds Axiom of Infinity (type e), Axiom of Infinity (type t).

The individuals are the natural numbers and identity at the evaluation arrow is literal, so no numeral counts them. The propositions that a given individual is fixed by the arrow, one for each individual, are pairwise distinct and each has that individual as finite support, so there are infinitely many propositions. The set of numerals at each type is invariant under every arrow, hence has empty support and lies in the domain, so finite cardinality is standard and no finite cardinality holds of the universal property at either type.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-09-20.*

### Fails Distinctness-preserving collapse.

The transposition of $5$ and $6$ is an arrow with an inverse, so for any true $q$ the composite of a member of $q$ with the inverse carries the transposition into $q$, making $\Diamond q$ true there, while the true proposition that $5$ is fixed is false there.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-23.*

### Holds □Relational Choice.

The model is ideally full, hence extensionally full at every object (Appendix D, the remark after Definition D.3): for any set $R$ of tuples from the domains at an object $V$, the intension that assigns to every arrow out of $V$ into an object $U$ a fixed set $R_U$ of tuples from $U$’s domains, with $R_V=R$, is pinned down by $\emptyset$, so it is the intension of an element of $V^{\bar\sigma\to t}$ with extension $R$ at $1_V$. Given a relation $U$ serial at $V$, choose for each $x$ a $y$ with $(Ux)y$, by choice in the metatheory; the graph is such an $R$, and its element $S$ is functional and a subrelation of $U$ at $1_V$, both conditions being unboxed. The closed Relational Choice instance is true at an arrow $h\colon W_0\to V$ iff it is true at $1_V$ in the truncation by $h$, whose domains at $V$ are those of the model, so it holds at every arrow and $\Box$Relational Choice follows.

*By Cian Dorr (observation); recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-23.*

### Fails Boolean Completeness (type t), Countable Boolean Completeness.

Any set $F$ of propositions is the extension of the profile $\langle h,p\rangle\mapsto\{i : i\cdot p\in F\}$, and for $F$ the family of propositions $A_m$ that a map $W_0\to W_0$ is constant on $\{0,\ldots,2m-1\}$ and first changes value at $2m$, the least superset of $\bigcup F$ pinned down by $\{0,\ldots,N\}$, the maps whose first change is at an even position or beyond $N$, strictly shrinks as $N$ grows, so $F$ has no least upper bound. The family is countable in the model's sense, the relation pairing $A_m$ with the numeral $m$ being in the domain by extensional fullness, so Countable Boolean Completeness fails too.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-25.*

### Holds Necessity of Arithmetic.

At $W_0$ the finite cardinalities are the standard numerals and $I^*$ is true; at $W_1$ the numerals remain pairwise distinct, because they differ at the arrows back into $W_0$ and identity is necessary, $I^*$ is again true, the numerals are the finite cardinalities by extensional fullness, and $\operatorname{Sum}$ and $\operatorname{Prod}$ are standard, their graphs being in the domain; so every arithmetical sentence has its standard truth value at every world.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-25.*

### Fails □BF (type t).

At $W_1$ the arrow $c_n\colon W_1\to W_0$ picking $n$ sends a proposition $q$ to $\{j : c_{j(n)}\in q\}$ (with the arrow to $W_1$ added when $q$ contains $1_{W_1}$), a proposition pinned down by $\{n\}$, so the proposition that $0$ and $1$ are collapsed is in no such image; the profile holding at $\langle h,d\rangle$ iff $h=1_{W_1}$ or $d$ is in the image of $h$, pinned down by $\{0\}$, is necessary of every proposition at $W_1$ but not universal at the world $c_0$.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-25.*

### Fails Inextensible Comprehension.

At type $t\to t$, for the family $E$ of propositions $p_n$ that $n$ is fixed: for $Y$ inextensible with extension $E$ pinned down by the finite set $S$, pick $k\notin S$ and let $X$, pinned down by $S_X:=S\cup\{k\}$, hold at an arrow $h$ into $W_0$ exactly of the propositions $\{i : i(m)=n\}$ with $n\notin S_X$ and of the propositions $\{i : i(h(n))=n\}$ with $n\in S_X$; $X$ is necessary of every $p_n$, so $Y\le X$, yet at a map $h$ fixing $S$ pointwise and moving $k$, where $h\cdot Y=Y$, the extension of $X$ omits $p_k$.

*Address: `finite-support-two-object-all-maps#inextensible-comprehension`. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-25.*

### Holds B for sentences of Σ.

A closed $\Sigma$-sentence denotes what $P(d,\ldots,d)$ denotes for a pure $P$ and the individual $d$, and from any world some arrow into $W_0$ carries the current image of $d$ back to $d$, as all maps are arrows.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-25.*

### Fails Vicinity.

A true $w$ pinned down by a finite set $S$ contains every arrow agreeing with the identity on $S$, among them a map $W_0\to W_0$ that collapses two individuals $a\ne b$ outside $S$. The proposition that $a$ and $b$ are distinct is true, and it is possible at no arrow that collapses them, since a collapse persists under composition, so $w\not\le\Diamond(a\ne b)$.

*By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's request, 2026-09-27.*

### Fails Weakly Inextensible Comprehension.

The argument above against Inextensible Comprehension at type $t\to t$ uses only the unboxed matrix of inextensibility at the identity arrow of $W_0$, as the corresponding argument in the permutation model does.

*By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's request, 2026-09-27.*

### Holds □Intensional Choice.

For each object $U$ and type $\sigma$ fix a well-ordering $<_U$ of the domain $D^\sigma_U$, and let $W$ be the intension of type $\sigma\to\sigma\to t$ with $W(h):={<_{\operatorname{cod}h}}$. Its value depends only on the arrow's codomain, so by the condition it is in the domain, and at every world its extension well-orders that world's type-$\sigma$ domain. Given $F$ with $\Box\exists x\, .\,Fx$, put $G:=\lambda x\, .\,Fx\land\forall y\, .\,(Fy\to\neg Wyx)$, the $W$-least $F$. It is definable from $F$ and $W$, so in the domain; $G\le F$, and its extension at every arrow is the singleton of the least element of $F$'s. So Intensional Choice holds, and the same at every reachable object gives $\Box$Intensional Choice. Cian Dorr's observation that such models are qualitatively full, made precise.

*General argument `arguments/intensional-choice-well-ordering`. It requires that At every object reachable from the evaluation point, the domain contains every intension whose value at an arrow depends only on the arrow's codomain. Here: The model is ideally full at both objects, and an intension whose value at an arrow depends only on the arrow's codomain is pinned down by $\emptyset$ (Appendix D, the remark after Definition D.3). By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's suggestion, 2026-10-03.*

### Fails Witnessed Possibility, Separated Structure, Independence (signature Σ), Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ).

Let $c\in\Sigma$ have relational type $\tau$, so $c=\top_\tau$ necessarily. Witnessed Possibility fails for the pure formula $x\ne\top_\tau$, witnessed by $\bot_\tau$ but impossible of $c$; Separated Structure fails since $\lambda x\, .\,x$ and $\lambda x\, .\,\top_\tau$ agree on $c$ and differ; Independence (signature Σ) fails since $c$ denotes what the closed pure term $\top_\tau$ denotes; Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ) fails since $c=\top_\tau$ is a true identity that C(Σ) does not prove.

*General argument `arguments/sigma-top`. It requires that Every constant of Σ is relational, and each denotes the top element of its type. Here: This is the interpretation the definition fixes. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr’s request, 2026-09-22.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Moved from the group finite-support-one-object to the topic; it uses nothing about the model.

### Holds Transversal Choice.

For an equivalence relation at the evaluation point, a transversal of its extension there, chosen in the metatheory, is by extensional fullness the extension of an element of the domain; the equivalence and transversal conditions are unboxed.

*General argument `arguments/transversal-choice-extensionally-full`. It requires that The model is extensionally full at every object: every set of tuples from the domains at an object is the extension, at the identity arrow, of an element of the domain of the matching relational type there. Here: The model is ideally full, hence extensionally full at every object (Appendix D, the remark after Definition D.3). By Cian Dorr (observation); recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), on a question of Zachary Goodsell, after an observation of Christopher Sun, 2026-09-25.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The Relational Choice and Transversal Choice arguments merged into one, stated for every extensionally full model.

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Moved from the group finite-support-one-object to the topic. Its first sentence, deriving extensional fullness from ideal fullness, is now the group's reason for meeting extensionally-full.


## Notes

The cited construction is a model of the map’s relational-type framework. The description identifies its evaluation point; construction and verification are given at the PDF locations in References. Everything that implies these fails with them.

## History

The record's revision log before it was written as arguments.

- **2026-09-27** (Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's request) — Recorded the failure of Vicinity and of Weakly Inextensible Comprehension; arguments in the notes. Now violates: Vicinity, Weakly Inextensible Comprehension.
- **2026-09-25** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added Transversal Choice, by the argument recorded for Relational Choice: the model is extensionally full at every object, so for an equivalence relation at the evaluation point a transversal of its extension there, chosen in the metatheory, is the extension of an element pinned down by the empty set; the equivalence and transversal conditions are unboxed. Recorded on a question of Zachary Goodsell, after an observation of Christopher Sun. Now satisfies: Transversal Choice.
- **2026-09-25** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Settled Actuality, Atomicity (type t), Boolean Completeness (type t), Countable Boolean Completeness, □BF (type t) and Inextensible Comprehension as failing, and Necessity of Arithmetic, B for pure sentences and B for sentences of Σ as holding, with the arguments in the notes. Now satisfies: B for pure sentences, B for sentences of Σ, Necessity of Arithmetic. Now violates: Actuality, Atomicity (type t), Boolean Completeness (type t), Countable Boolean Completeness, □BF (type t), Inextensible Comprehension.
- **2026-09-25** (Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic)) — Merged the two sets of arguments recorded on 23 and 25 September into one, keeping the 23 September argument for Atomicity (type t).
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Expanded the description from Appendix D; settled the Distinctness-preserving collapse. Now violates: Distinctness-preserving collapse.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added Relational Choice and its necessitation at Cian Dorr’s direction: ideally full models are extensionally full at every object, and choice in the metatheory supplies the functional subrelation; see the notes. Now satisfies: Relational Choice, □Relational Choice.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Recorded the failure of Atomicity (type t), and with it of the Strong Leibniz Biconditionals; see the notes. Now violates: Atomicity (type t).
- **2026-09-22** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Fixed an interpretation of Σ (relational constants as top, individual constants as one fixed individual) and recorded the signature schemata it refutes, at Cian Dorr’s request. Now violates: Witnessed Possibility, Separated Structure, Independence (signature Σ), Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ).
- **2026-09-20** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added both Axioms of Infinity at Cian Dorr's direction. The individuals are the natural numbers and identity at the evaluation arrow is literal, so no numeral counts them. The propositions that a given individual is fixed by the arrow, one for each individual, are pairwise distinct and each has that individual as finite support, so there are infinitely many propositions. The set of numerals at each type is invariant under every arrow, hence has empty support and lies in the domain, so finite cardinality is standard and no finite cardinality holds of the universal property at either type. Now satisfies: Axiom of Infinity (type e), Axiom of Infinity (type t).
- **2026-09-19** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added the failure of Atomlessness at N, witnessed by the proposition that there is exactly one individual, which is the singleton of the arrow to {0}. Original observation; not in the source.
- **2026-09-17** (OpenAI Codex (GPT-6)) — Adopted the source’s relational type system at the user’s request. The cited construction now directly supplies the recorded model; the former type-extension obligation is removed. Now satisfies: BF. Now violates: □BF.
