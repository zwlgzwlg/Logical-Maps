## Premises

- **Distinctness-preserving collapse.** Every truth is necessary under the distinctness-preserving modality.
- **ND.** Distinct things of any type are necessarily distinct.

## Conclusion

- **Fregean Axiom.** Materially equivalent propositions are identical.

## Proof

Under ND the two necessities coincide. If $\Box_{\ne}p$, there is a true $q$ with $\Box(\Diamond q\to p)$; $q$ true gives $q\ne\bot$, and ND at type $t$ gives $\Box(q\ne\bot)$, that is $\Box\Diamond q$; K then gives $\Box p$. So the collapse yields $\forall p\, .\,p\to\Box p$: every truth is $\top$. Then materially equivalent propositions are identical: if both are true both are $\top$; if both are false their negations are $\top$, so both are $\bot$. That is the Fregean Axiom.

## Notes

The converse of the first step holds without ND: $\Box p$ gives $\Box_{\ne}p$ with $q:=\top$. So ND makes $\Diamond$ and $\Diamond_{\ne}$ coextensive, and with it the collapse is Extensionalism. This settles the collapse as false in every model with ND and more than two propositions.
