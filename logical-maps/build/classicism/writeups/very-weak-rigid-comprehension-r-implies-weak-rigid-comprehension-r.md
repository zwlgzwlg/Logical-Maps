# Very Weak Rigid Comprehension ⇒ Weak Rigid Comprehension

## Premises

- **Very Weak Rigid Comprehension.** Every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a very weakly rigid one, that is, with one that is weakly persistent and weakly inextensible.

## Conclusion

- **Weak Rigid Comprehension.** Every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a weakly rigid one, that is, with one that is persistent and weakly inextensible.

## Proof

Let $Y$ be very weakly rigid and coextensive with $X$, and put $Y':=\lambda\bar z\, .\,\Box Y[\bar z]$.

Coextensiveness. $\Box Y[\bar u]\to Y[\bar u]$ by T, and $Y[\bar u]\to\Box Y[\bar u]$ is $\operatorname{WeaklyPersistent}(Y)$. So $Y'$ is coextensive with $Y$, hence with $X$.

Persistence. $Y'\le\lambda\bar z\, .\,\Box Y'[\bar z]$ is $\Box\forall\bar z\, .\,\Box Y[\bar z]\to\Box\Box Y[\bar z]$, the necessitation of the 4 axiom, which is a theorem of C.

Weak inextensibility. Suppose $\forall\bar z\, .\,Y'[\bar z]\to\Box Z[\bar z]$. Weak persistence gives $\forall\bar z\, .\,Y[\bar z]\to Y'[\bar z]$, so $\forall\bar z\, .\,Y[\bar z]\to\Box Z[\bar z]$, and $\operatorname{WeaklyInextensible}(Y)$ gives $Y\le Z$. Also $Y'\le Y$, since that is the necessitation of T. So $Y'\le Z$ by transitivity.

Hence $Y'$ is weakly rigid and coextensive with $X$.

## Notes

With the converse this makes the two principles equivalent, although very weak rigidity is strictly weaker than weak rigidity as a condition on a given relation, since nothing stops a very weakly rigid relation from being only contingently so.
