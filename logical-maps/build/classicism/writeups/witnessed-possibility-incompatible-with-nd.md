# Witnessed Possibility ∧ ND ⇒ ⊥

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Logical Combinatorialism; produced by Andrew Bacon; adapted to Witnessed Possibility and the map's signature by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 19 September 2026, at the suggestion of Cian Dorr; recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 19 September 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **Witnessed Possibility.** For pure-formulas P with free variables among a finite tuple x, and distinct matching nonlogical constants c, a witness to P entails that P at those constants is possible.
- **ND.** Distinct things of any type are necessarily distinct.

## Conclusion

- **⊥.** These premises cannot all hold together.

## Proof

Let $c$ be a nonlogical constant of $\Sigma$ of some relational type $\tau$; the signature assumption in Background supplies one. The pure formulas $x=\top_\tau$ and $x\ne\top_\tau$, with only $x^\tau$ free, have C-provable existential closures, witnessed by $\top_\tau$ and $\bot_\tau$ respectively. Witnessed Possibility therefore gives $\Diamond(c=\top_\tau)$ and $\Diamond(c\ne\top_\tau)$. If $c=\top_\tau$, then by Leibniz's law $(c\ne\top_\tau)=(\top_\tau\ne\top_\tau)=\bot$, contradicting $\Diamond(c\ne\top_\tau)$. If $c\ne\top_\tau$, then ND at type $\tau$ gives $\Box(c\ne\top_\tau)$, i.e. $(c\ne\top_\tau)=\top$, so $(c=\top_\tau)=\bot$, contradicting $\Diamond(c=\top_\tau)$.

## Notes

The argument follows Bacon's, with two changes. Witnessed Possibility replaces the biconditional Logical Necessity, since only the possibility direction is used. The top element $\top_\tau$ replaces Bacon's second fundamental constant, because the map's signature assumes only one constant of some type $\tau\ne e$ and does not assume that distinct constants denote distinct entities (compare Bacon's n. 29, which uses $\lambda x\, .\,\top$ and $\lambda x\, .\,\bot$). ND is used only at the type $\tau$ of the chosen constant.

Bacon derives from Logical Necessity that distinct fundamental entities are possibly identical (his (4)), so that distinctness is contingent and the Brouwerian axiom, and with it ND (Prior), fail.

Note 57 identifies Witnessed Possibility with one direction of Logical Necessity and observes that it follows from Maximalist Classicism, which p. 41 shows to be inconsistent with ND.
