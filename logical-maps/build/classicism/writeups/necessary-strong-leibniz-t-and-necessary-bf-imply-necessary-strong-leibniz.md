# □Strong Leibniz Biconditionals (type t) ∧ □BF ⇒ □Strong Leibniz Biconditionals

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Misc.; produced by Cian Dorr, question of 23 September 2026; proof written out by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic); recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 23 September 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **□Strong Leibniz Biconditionals (type t).** Necessarily, every possible proposition is entailed by a strong world proposition, one that is possible and necessarily entails every proposition or its negation.
- **□BF.** Necessarily, the Barcan Formula holds at every type. The predicate formulation closes the formula schema using lambda abstraction.

## Conclusion

- **□Strong Leibniz Biconditionals.** Necessarily, at each relational type, every possible entity (one distinct from bottom) is entailed by a strong world: a possible entity that necessarily entails every entity of the type or its negation.

## Proof

First the unboxed statement, for a relational type $\tau=\bar\sigma t$. Let $X^\tau\ne\bot$. Intensionality’s contrapositive gives $\Diamond\exists\bar y\, .\,X\bar y$, and BF at the argument types gives $\bar x$ with $\Diamond X\bar x$. The type-t Strong Leibniz Biconditionals give a strong world $w\le X\bar x$: $w\ne\bot$ and $\Box\forall q\, .\,(w\le q\lor w\le\neg q)$. Put $W:=\lambda\bar y\, .\,w\land\bar y=\bar x$. Then $W\ne\bot$, since $W\bar x=w$, and $W\le X$, since $\Box(w\to X\bar x)$ and Leibniz’s law give $\Box\forall\bar y\, .\,W\bar y\to X\bar y$ by K. $W$ is a strong world at $\tau$: under the box, for any $Y^\tau$, instantiate the strong-world clause of $w$ at $q:=Y\bar x$; if $w\le Y\bar x$ then $\Box\forall\bar y\, .\,W\bar y\to Y\bar y$, that is $W\le Y$, by the same K step, and if $w\le\neg Y\bar x$ then $W\le\neg Y$ likewise; so $\Box\forall Y\, .\,(W\le Y\lor W\le\neg Y)$, the passage under the outer box being by necessitation and K since each step is a theorem of C. For each $\tau$ this derives the closed instance $\mathrm{SL}_\tau$ from $\mathrm{SL}_t$ and finitely many BF instances in C; necessitating that conditional and applying K gives $\Box\mathrm{SL}_\tau$ from $\Box\mathrm{SL}_t$ and $\Box$BF.

## Notes

The unboxed form, Strong Leibniz Biconditionals (type t) + BF ⇒ Strong Leibniz Biconditionals, is already derivable on the map through Atomicity: SL (t) gives Atomicity (t), Atomicity (t) + BF gives Atomicity, and Atomicity + BF gives SL. The direct construction above proves it in one step and is what is necessitated here; the boxed form was not derivable, since no record boxes the type-t instance of Atomicity. Only BF at the argument types of the target type is used, as in atomicity-t-and-bf-imply-atomicity.
