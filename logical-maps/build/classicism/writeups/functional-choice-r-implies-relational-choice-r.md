# Functional Choice ⇒ Relational Choice

## Premises

- **Functional Choice.** Every serial binary relation admits a selecting operation. Its output type is relational, as required by the type system.

## Conclusion

- **Relational Choice.** Every serial binary relation has a functional subrelation.

## Proof

Choose an operation X selecting from the serial relation U. Its graph, $\lambda x y\, .\,Xx=y$, is a functional subrelation of U. If the output type is e, first replace each output individual by its haecceity of type et. Functional Choice selects such a haecceity; equality with that selected haecceity defines a functional subrelation of the original relation. Haecceities are injective by identity elimination, so this covers the individual-output case without assuming a selecting operation into e.
