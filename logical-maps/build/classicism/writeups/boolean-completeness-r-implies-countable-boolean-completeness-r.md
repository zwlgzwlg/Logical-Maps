# Boolean Completeness ⇒ Countable Boolean Completeness

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Arithmetic is Necessary (2024 draft), Lean `Classicism.Map.boolean_completeness_r_implies_countable_boolean_completeness_r`; produced by Zachary Goodsell; recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 20 September 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **Boolean Completeness.** Every property of entities of a relational type has a greatest lower bound in that type.

## Conclusion

- **Countable Boolean Completeness.** Every countable property of entities of a relational type has a least upper bound in that type, where a property is countable when it injects into the natural numbers.

## Proof

Countable Boolean Completeness is the restriction of Boolean Completeness to countable properties. The map's Boolean Completeness supplies greatest lower bounds; the least upper bound of $X$ is the pointwise negation of the greatest lower bound of $\lambda y\, .\,X(\neg y)$, by the Boolean laws that Logical Equivalence makes identities, so every property, countable or not, has a least upper bound.

## Notes

The source presents the restriction as immediate. The converse is not expected; the source uses only the countable case.
