## Premises

- **ND.** Distinct things of any type are necessarily distinct.
- **BF.** The Barcan Formula at every type. The predicate formulation closes the formula schema using lambda abstraction.

## Conclusion

- **□ND.** Necessarily, distinct things of any type are necessarily distinct.

## Proof

For arbitrary x,y, classical identity cases, NI and ND give $\Box(x=y)\lor\Box(x\ne y)$. Using 4, strengthen the second disjunct to $\Box\Box(x\ne y)$. Normal modal reasoning yields $\Box(x=y\lor\Box(x\ne y))$, equivalently $\Box(x\ne y\to\Box(x\ne y))$. Generalize over x,y and apply BF twice to box the entire universal closure. Repeat at each type.
