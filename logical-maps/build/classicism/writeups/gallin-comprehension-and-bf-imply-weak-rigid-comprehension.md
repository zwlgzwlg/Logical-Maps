## Premises

- **Gallin Extensional Comprehension.** Every relation is coextensive with one that is persistent and has a persistent pointwise negation. This is the source’s comparison with Gallin’s different rigidity convention.
- **BF.** The Barcan Formula at every type. The predicate formulation closes the formula schema using lambda abstraction.

## Conclusion

- **Weak Rigid Comprehension.** Every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a weakly rigid one, that is, with one that is persistent and weakly inextensible.

## Proof

Let $X$ be given and let $Y$ be the coextension that Gallin Extensional Comprehension supplies, with $Y$ and $\neg Y$ persistent. Persistence of $Y$ is the first conjunct of weak rigidity. For weak inextensibility, let $Z$ satisfy $\forall\bar x\, .\,Y[\bar x]\to\Box Z[\bar x]$. For any $\bar x$, either $Y[\bar x]$, and then $\Box Z[\bar x]$, or $\neg Y[\bar x]$, and then $\Box\neg Y[\bar x]$ by persistence of $\neg Y$ (with T); in both cases $\Box(Y[\bar x]\to Z[\bar x])$ by K. So $\forall\bar x\, .\,\Box(Y[\bar x]\to Z[\bar x])$, and BF, applied to the abstract $\lambda\bar x\, .\,Y[\bar x]\to Z[\bar x]$ one argument at a time, gives $\Box\forall\bar x\, .\,Y[\bar x]\to Z[\bar x]$, which is $Y\le Z$. Hence $Y$ is weakly rigid and coextensive with $X$.

## Notes

The direct argument, using BF once and at the world of evaluation. The claim strengthens: the same witness is fully rigid, since Gallin Extensional Comprehension gives ND, ND with BF gives □ND, □ND gives □BF, and with BF at every world the same argument runs inside the box of inextensibility; that is the recorded gallin-comprehension-and-bf-imply-rigid-comprehension, of which this record is therefore a consequence. It is kept because it isolates what BF at the evaluation world alone buys.

The map was built from the draft dated 16 May 2023, 87 pages, which does not differ materially from the published version; all page, proposition and footnote locators in this map refer to that draft's numbering. — §2.3, n. 37, p. 28. The source's note states that under BF a relation persistent together with its negation is inextensible; this record is the part of that argument that uses BF at the world of evaluation only.
