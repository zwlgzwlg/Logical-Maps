# Fregean Axiom ⇒ Distinctness-preserving collapse

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Misc., Lean `Classicism.Map.fregean_axiom_implies_distinctness_preserving_collapse`; produced by Cian Dorr, suggestion of 23 September 2026; proof written out by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 23 September 2026; recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 23 September 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **Fregean Axiom.** Materially equivalent propositions are identical.

## Conclusion

- **Distinctness-preserving collapse.** Every truth is necessary under the distinctness-preserving modality.

## Proof

Under the Fregean Axiom a true $p$ is materially equivalent to $\top$, hence identical to it, so $\Box p$. And $\Box p$ gives $\Box_{\ne}p$: take $q:=\top$, which is true, and $\Box(\Diamond\top\to p)$ is $\Box p$.

## Notes

With the converse record, the collapse is equivalent to the Fregean Axiom in the presence of ND, while without ND it is weaker: the coalesced-sum roots satisfy it with infinitely many propositions.
