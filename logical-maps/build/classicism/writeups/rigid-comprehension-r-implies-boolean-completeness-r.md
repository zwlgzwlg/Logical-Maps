## Premises

- **Rigid Comprehension.** Every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a rigid one.

## Conclusion

- **Boolean Completeness.** Every property of entities of a relational type has a greatest lower bound in that type.

## Proof

For a property X of relations, choose a rigid coextension $X^*$. Define $U=\lambda\bar z\, .\,\forall Y\, .\,X^*Y\to Y[\bar z]$. For any V, being a lower bound of X is equivalent to being one of $X^*$; rigidity turns the pointwise necessary consequences for members of $X^*$ into their necessary universal generalization. This says exactly $V\le U$. Thus the lower bounds of X are precisely the entities below U, which is the GLB condition. This works at each relational type.
