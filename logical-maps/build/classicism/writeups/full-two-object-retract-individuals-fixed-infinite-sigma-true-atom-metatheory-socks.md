<p class='cert'>Model — Source: Classicism (2024); produced by Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr; recorded by OpenAI Codex (GPT-6), prompted by Zachary Goodsell, 17 September 2026.</p>

## Package

- **Arithmetic Necessitism.** Given that necessarily zero is not a successor and successor is injective on numbers, the numbers at $\sigma$ form a rigid property with necessarily distinct instances. One sentence for each type $\sigma$.
- **Gallin Extensional Comprehension.** Every relation is coextensive with one that is persistent and has a persistent pointwise negation. This is the source’s comparison with Gallin’s different rigidity convention.
- **□Atomicity.** Necessarily, every non-bottom entity of each relational type has an atom below it.
- **□Self-atoms are atoms.** Necessarily, at each relational type, every self-atom is an atom.
- **□Rigid Comprehension.** Necessarily, every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a rigid one.
- **□Self-atoms are strong atoms.** Necessarily, at each relational type, every self-atom is a strong atom: it necessarily entails every entity of the type or its negation.
- **Axiom of Infinity (type e).** There are not finitely many individuals. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **Infinity Schema (type e).** There are arbitrarily many pairwise distinct entities of this fixed type; one sentence for each positive integer n.
- **□Intensional Choice.** Necessarily, if a property is necessarily instantiated, then some property entailing it is necessarily uniquely instantiated.
- **ND.** Distinct things of any type are necessarily distinct.
- **Rigid Power.** If a relation is rigid, so is the property of being a rigid relation that entails it.
- **□Rigid Power.** Necessarily, if a relation is rigid, so is the property of being a rigid relation that entails it.
- **Necessity of Second-Order Analysis.** Every second-order analytical sentence is either true in every real number structure in every possible world or false in every real number structure in every possible world. One sentence for each type $\sigma$ and each second-order analytical sentence.
- **Strong Actuality.** There is a true strong atom: a true proposition that necessarily entails every proposition or its negation.
- **□Strong Actuality.** Necessarily, there is a true strong atom: a true proposition that necessarily entails every proposition or its negation.
- **¬ Truths are ND-necessary.** Every truth is ND-necessary, that is, necessary under the distinctness-preserving modality.
- **¬ Possible Infinity (type t).** Possibly there are not finitely many propositions: the Axiom of Infinity at this type, under a diamond.
- **¬ Infinity Schema (type t).** There are arbitrarily many pairwise distinct entities of this fixed type; one sentence for each positive integer n.
- **¬ Axiom of Infinity (type t).** There are not finitely many propositions. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **¬ Self-Atomicity (type t).** Every possible proposition is entailed by a self-atom: a possible proposition that necessarily, if true, is an atom, that is, one that entails that it is the actual world.
- **¬ Atoms are self-atoms (type t).** Every atom is a self-atom: necessarily, if it is true, it is an atom.
- **¬ Strong Atomicity (type t).** Every possible proposition is entailed by a strong atom, one that is possible and necessarily entails every proposition or its negation.
- **¬ Fregean Axiom.** Materially equivalent propositions are identical.
- **¬ No Contingency (signature Σ).** Each closed sentence of the language of the fixed signature Sigma, if true, is necessary. A sentence schema, standing to No Pure Contingency as Possibility Maximalism (signature Σ) stands to Possibility Maximalism (pure).
- **¬ Witnessed Possibility.** For pure-formulas P with free variables among a finite tuple x, and distinct matching nonlogical constants c, a witness to P entails that P at those constants is possible.
- **¬ Separated Structure.** For each typed nonlogical constant c and closed same-typed terms F,G not containing c, equality after application to c implies equality of F and G.
- **¬ Independence (signature Σ).** No constant of Sigma is a pure operation applied to other constants: for a closed pure term A and distinct constants c, d_1,…,d_n with n ≥ 0, c differs from A applied to the d’s. With n = 0, no constant denotes a pure entity.
- **¬ Maximalism (signature Σ).** The Maximalism schema for the fixed nonlogical signature Σ: every closed identity of its language not provable in C(Σ) is false.
- **¬ Relational Choice.** Every serial binary relation has a functional subrelation.

## Definition

Use the source’s category with h:W0→W1, j:W1→W0 and k:W1→W1, evaluated at W0.

Individuals, fixed for this record: at every object the individuals are the members of an infinite set $D$, the same at every object, and every arrow acts on them as the identity.

Interpretation of Σ, fixed for this record: one designated relational constant $c$ of type $\tau=\bar\sigma t$ denotes $\lambda\bar x\, .\,a$, where $a$ is the unique true atom of the model, the actual-world proposition $\{1\}$; every other constant of Σ, of which there is at least one, is relational and denotes the top element of its type.

Metatheory, fixed for this record: the construction is carried out in ZF together with a countable family $(P_n)_{n\in\omega}$ of pairwise disjoint two-element sets that has no choice function (Russell's socks), which is consistent with ZF (Fraenkel's second permutation model, transferred to ZF by the Jech–Sochor theorem). Every infinite set the construction leaves unspecified (the individuals, the worlds, a carrier) is their union. The verdicts of this record are relative-consistency claims of the same standing as those of a record with choice.

## Arguments

### Holds Analytic Necessitism, Second-Order Analytic Necessitism.

*Withdrawn 2026-10-30 by GPT-6 Astra, prompted by Daniel Kodsi: The stated hypotheses do not establish the native all-carrier AN/SOAN schemata. A structure at tt (or another selected carrier) does not answer an instance at e or t. A counterexample is the full one-object model on the countable monoid with an absorbing zero and fixed natural-number individuals, where an actual real field at t has no necessarily distinct carrier. See [proof](../writeups/analytic-necessitism-carrier-correction.md), sections 1–3, for the full countermodels and exact condition checks. The original text and attribution are preserved; its selected-carrier construction is not rejected by this withdrawal.*

At type $\tau:=et$, as analytic-necessitism-codomain-everywhere with the individuals in place of the propositions: the individuals are the same infinite set $D$ at every object, so the codomain-only intension $Y_A$ whose value at every arrow is $E^A$, for an injection $A\mapsto E^A$ from the sets of natural numbers into the sets of individuals, is in the domain, and its transports are the $Y_A$ of the targets, distinct for distinct $A$; the real number structure on the $Y_A$ by codomain-only relations is carried along every arrow to an isomorphic one. Such a structure is rigid, its instances are necessarily distinct, and it is necessarily a real number structure; and the codomain-only intension of type $((\tau)^kt)t$ whose value at each object is the set of codomain-only $k$-ary relations among the carrier there is a represented power of arity $k$, since at every world each $k$-ary relation agrees on the carrier with one of them. So the consequents of Analytic Necessitism and of its second-order form hold, and both principles hold. (The argument of the withdrawn analytic-necessitism-unretracted-arrow would refute this structure; its step from inextensibility is the gap.)

*General argument `arguments/analytic-necessitism-codomain-fixed-infinite-individuals`. It requires that At every object reachable from the evaluation point, the domain contains every intension whose value at an arrow depends only on the arrow's codomain. Here: The domains are full at every object. It requires that At every object the individuals are the same infinite set, and every arrow acts on them as the identity. Here: This is the choice of individuals. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), prompted by Cian Dorr, auditing the withdrawn arguments for the failure of Analytic Necessitism, 2026-10-29.*

*Revised 2026-10-30 by GPT-6 Astra, prompted by Daniel Kodsi:* Withdrawn as an all-type sufficient-condition argument, following the 29 October counterexamples proved in the accompanying write-up. This does not assert failure of AN in every model formerly using this argument. Specific full-action replacements are proved in sections 4–5 of the linked write-up.

### Fails Analytic Necessitism.

*Withdrawn 2026-10-29 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), prompted by Cian Dorr, after a trawl subagent's report: The step from $k\cdot y=k\cdot x\in X_k$ to $Xy$ (or $y\in X_h$) by inextensibility does not follow: inextensibility bounds a rigid carrier from above, by the transports of its actual instances, and puts nothing new into its actual extension. The conclusion is false in many of the models the argument was applied to: entities fixed by every arrow, or transported injectively, can carry a rigid real number structure that is necessarily one (see analytic-necessitism-codomain-fixed and analytic-necessitism-full-continuum).*

As the argument analytic-necessitism-noninvertible-retracted-arrow: an arrow $h\colon w\to v$ out of the evaluation object with a retraction $j$ but no inverse gives the idempotent $e:=h\circ j$ out of $v$, which has no retraction, and a rigid real number structure at $w$ at a relational type, necessarily a real number structure, would have at $h$ a complete ordered field of instances each determined by its transport along $e$, which no entity of a relational type at $v$ is, the model being full there. The antecedent of Analytic Necessitism holds at the relational type $((et)t)t$, as in the argument analytic-necessitism-unretracted-arrow-individuals, the individuals at $w$ being infinitely many. So Analytic Necessitism fails. No choice is used.

*General argument `arguments/analytic-necessitism-noninvertible-retracted-arrow-individuals`. It requires that The model is a full action model: an action model (Classicism, Appendix D) that is full at every object. Here: An action model, full at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59; Appendix D). It requires that Some arrow out of the evaluation object has a retraction but is not invertible. Here: $h$ is retracted by $j$ but $h\circ j=k\ne 1_{W_1}$. It requires that There are infinitely many individuals at the evaluation world. Here: $D$ is infinite. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Zachary Goodsell, 2026-10-23.*

### Holds Arithmetic Necessitism.

The numbers at a type $\sigma$ are the instances of $\mathbb N_\sigma$, the least property containing $\mathbf 0_\sigma$ and closed under $\operatorname{Suc}_\sigma$ (Background); the numerals $\mathbf 0_\sigma$, $\operatorname{Suc}_\sigma\mathbf 0_\sigma,\ldots$ are closed terms, so each denotes at every object, and transport along an arrow carries its denotation at the source to its denotation at the target. At any object $v$ reachable from the evaluation point, extensional fullness gives a property whose extension at $v$ is exactly the numerals there; it contains $\mathbf 0_\sigma$ and is closed under successor, so the numbers at $v$ are exactly the numerals, every numeral being an instance of every inductive property. Persistence of $\mathbb N_\sigma$ and, given $\Box I^*_\sigma$, the necessary distinctness of the numbers are theorems of C (the proof of necessary-rigid-comprehension-implies-arithmetic-necessitism). Inextensibility, $\Box\forall X\,.\,(\forall n\,.\,\mathbb N_\sigma n\to\Box Xn)\to\mathbb N_\sigma\le X$: at a reachable $v$ and for an arrow $j$ from $v$ to $u$, the numbers at $u$ are the numerals there, which are the transports along $j$ of the numbers at $v$, so any $X$ that necessarily holds of the numbers at $v$ holds at $u$ of the numbers there. So $\mathbb N_\sigma$ is rigid, and Arithmetic Necessitism holds at every type. No choice is used.

*General argument `arguments/arithmetic-necessitism-extensionally-full`. It requires that The model is extensionally full at every object: every set of tuples from the domains at an object is the extension, at the identity arrow, of an element of the domain of the matching relational type there. Here: A full model contains every intension, so in particular one with any given extension at the identity. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Zachary Goodsell, 2026-10-23.*

### Holds Gallin Extensional Comprehension.

Given $X$ with extension $E$ at the evaluation object, let $Y$ hold at an arrow $g$ of a tuple $\bar b$ at $g$'s target iff $r_g\cdot\bar b\in E$; it is in the domain since the model is full. It is coextensive with $X$, since $r_1=1$. And whether it holds is unchanged along every arrow: at $x\circ g$, of $x\cdot\bar b$, it holds iff $r_{x\circ g}\cdot x\cdot\bar b=r_g\cdot\bar b\in E$. So $Y$ and its negation are persistent. (The retract's own argument of 25 September, generalized.)

*General argument `arguments/coherent-retractions`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that Every arrow $g$ out of the evaluation object has a retraction $r_g$, chosen so that $r_{x\circ g}\circ x=r_g$ for every arrow $x$ after $g$. Here: Every arrow into $W_0$ is the one function to its single member, so any choice is coherent. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Fails Truths are ND-necessary.

Let $p:=\{1\}$, in the domain since the model is full, and true. Any witness $q$ for $\Box_{\ne}p$ is true, so contains the identity; under an arrow $i\ne 1$ with a retraction $r$, the arrow $r\circ i=1$ makes $\Diamond q$ true, while $p$ is false. So no true $q$ has $\Box(\Diamond q\to p)$. (The surjection monoid's own argument of 23 September, stated once.)

*General argument `arguments/dpc-returning-arrow`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that Some arrow out of the evaluation object other than its identity has a retraction: an arrow back after which it composes to the identity. Here: $h$, which $j$ retracts. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Fails Possible Infinity (type t).

At a world with $n$ propositions, the numeral $\operatorname{Suc}^n_t\mathbf{0}_t$, a finite cardinality, holds of the universal property of propositions, so the Axiom of Infinity at type $t$ fails there. It fails at every world, so Possible Infinity at type $t$ fails.

*General argument `arguments/finitely-many-propositions-everywhere`. It requires that There are finitely many propositions at every object reachable from the evaluation point. Here: $W_0$ has four propositions and $W_1$ eight, the sets of its three arrows out. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Fails Infinity Schema (type t), Axiom of Infinity (type t).

The propositions at the evaluation world are finitely many, and every intension of a full model is present, so the numerals are the finite cardinalities and one of them holds of the universal property of propositions: the Axiom of Infinity at type t fails, as does an instance of the schema.

*General argument `arguments/finitely-many-propositions`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that There are finitely many propositions at the evaluation world. Here: $W_0$ has four propositions, the sets of its two arrows out. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-09-20.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The copies in three full action models (each with four propositions) stated once for the topic; each record's count is its reason for meeting finitely-many-propositions.

*Revised 2026-10-06 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The Axiom of Infinity's failure, which the text states, recorded as a verdict of its own, so that it is certified without the result that the Axiom implies the schema.

### Holds □Atomicity.

Entailment is inclusion of intensions. Below a relation $Y\ne\bot_\tau$ lies the relation whose intension is the singleton of one of $Y$'s tuples, which is in the domain since the model is full, and is an atom: its only proper part is $\bot_\tau$. Every object being full, the same holds at every arrow, so Atomicity is necessary. The source notes that full models are atomic (p. 61); stated once for the topic, in place of the full models' own arguments.

*Source: Classicism, p. 61. General argument `arguments/full-atomicity`. It requires that The model is a full action model: an action model (Classicism, Appendix D) that is full at every object. Here: An action model, full at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59; Appendix D). By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Holds □Self-atoms are atoms.

The argument of full-comparable-free-arrows-self-atoms at every reachable object: a self-atom there is a singleton intension, so an atom.

*General argument `arguments/full-comparable-free-arrows-everywhere-self-atoms`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that At every object reachable from the evaluation point, any two arrows out of it that are each fixed under post-composition only by the identity are comparable: one is a left multiple of the other. Here: Out of $W_0$ only $1$ is fixed by nothing but the identity, $h$ being fixed by $k$; out of $W_1$ the arrows fixed only by the identity are $1$ and $j$ ($k$ is fixed by $k$), and $j=j\circ1$. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Cian Dorr, 25 October 2026.*

### Fails Self-Atomicity (type t), Atoms are self-atoms (type t).

Let $m\ne1$ fix $k$: $m\circ k=k$. The singleton $\{k\}$, in the domain since the model is full, is an atom. Its transport along $k$ is $\{x : x\circ k=k\}$, which contains $1$ and $m$, and the proposition $\{1\}$ at $k$’s target, in the domain there, separates them; so $\{k\}$ is true at $k$ without being an atom there, and it is not a self-atom. As $\{k\}$ is the only possible proposition below itself, Self-Atomicity (type t) fails too.

*General argument `arguments/full-fixed-arrow-no-self-atom`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that Some arrow $k$ out of the evaluation object is fixed by a non-identity arrow: $m\circ k=k$ with $m\ne1$. Here: $k\circ h=h$ with $k\ne1_{W_1}$. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Cian Dorr, 25 October 2026.*

### Holds □Rigid Comprehension.

Given $X$ of type $\tau$ at an object $W$, let $Y$ be the relation whose extension at an arrow $i$ out of $W$ is $X$'s extension at $W$ transported along $i$, which is in the domain since the model is full. It is coextensive with $X$. It is persistent, since its extension at $i\circ j$ is its extension at $i$ transported along $j$. And it is inextensible: if $\Box X'$ holds at $i$ of everything $Y$ holds of there, then at $i\circ j$ everything $Y$ holds of is the transport along $j$ of something $Y$ holds of at $i$, of which $X'$ then holds. Every object being full, the same holds at every arrow, so Rigid Comprehension is necessary. The source notes that full models satisfy it (p. 61); stated once for the topic, in place of the full models' own arguments.

*Source: Classicism, p. 61. General argument `arguments/full-rigid-comprehension`. It requires that The model is a full action model: an action model (Classicism, Appendix D) that is full at every object. Here: An action model, full at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59; Appendix D). By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Holds □Self-atoms are strong atoms.

The argument of full-uniquely-factored-self-atoms-strong at every reachable object.

*General argument `arguments/full-uniquely-factored-everywhere-self-atoms-strong`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that At every object reachable from the evaluation point, any two arrows out of it that are each fixed under post-composition only by the identity are comparable: one is a left multiple of the other. Here: Out of $W_0$ only $1$ is fixed by nothing but the identity, $h$ being fixed by $k$; out of $W_1$ the arrows fixed only by the identity are $1$ and $j$ ($k$ is fixed by $k$), and $j=j\circ1$. It requires that At every object reachable from the evaluation point, every arrow $k$ out of it that is fixed only by the identity factors through each arrow $h$ out of it in at most one way: $m\circ h=m^{\prime}\circ h=k$ implies $m=m^{\prime}$. Here: At $W_0$, $1=m\circ h$ forces $m=j$ and $1=m\circ1$ forces $m=1$; at $W_1$, $j=m\circ k$ forces $m\circ h=1$, so $m=j$, and $j=m\circ j$ or $1=m\circ x$ force $m=1$ and $x=1$. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Cian Dorr, 25 October 2026.*

### Holds Axiom of Infinity (type e), Infinity Schema (type e).

The Infinity schema holds, there being $n$ distinct individuals for every $n$. For the Axiom: by extensional fullness the domain has a property of cardinalities true of $Z$ exactly when every property $Z$ holds of has a finite extension. It holds of $\mathbf{0}_e$, which holds only of empty properties, and passes from $Y$ to $\operatorname{Suc}_e Y$, which holds of $F$ only if $Y$ holds of $F$ less one of its instances. So every finite cardinality has it, and none holds of the universal property, whose extension is infinite.

*General argument `arguments/infinitely-many-individuals`. It requires that The model is extensionally full at every object: every set of tuples from the domains at an object is the extension, at the identity arrow, of an element of the domain of the matching relational type there. Here: A full model contains every intension, so in particular one with any given extension at the identity. It requires that There are infinitely many individuals at the evaluation world. Here: $D$ is infinite. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Holds □Intensional Choice.

At an object reachable from the evaluation point the propositions are all the sets of arrows out of it, so there are finitely many arrows out. A necessarily instantiated $F$ there assigns to each of them a nonempty set, and a finite family of nonempty sets has a choice function without the axiom of choice; the intension holding at each arrow of the chosen member alone is in the domain, the model being full, lies below $F$ and is necessarily uniquely instantiated. So Intensional Choice holds at every reachable object, at every type. (The finite-germ argument of the 3 October 2026 analysis, for full models; with choice the well-ordering argument gives the same.)

*General argument `arguments/intensional-choice-finitely-many-arrows`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that There are finitely many propositions at every object reachable from the evaluation point. Here: $W_0$ has four propositions and $W_1$ eight, the sets of its three arrows out. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-08.*

### Fails Strong Atomicity (type t).

Let $k$ out of the evaluation object have distinct $j\ne j^{\prime}$ after it with $j\circ k= j^{\prime}\circ k$. The proposition $\{j\circ k\}$, in the domain since the model is full, is possible, and the only possible proposition below it is itself. It is not a strong atom: under $k$ it becomes $\{m : m\circ k=j\circ k\}$, which contains $j$ and $j^{\prime}$, and the proposition $\{j\}$ at $k$'s target, in the domain there, neither contains nor excludes it. So the type-$t$ Strong Atomicity fails. (The idempotent monoid's and the retract's own arguments of 22–23 September, stated once.)

*General argument `arguments/nonepic-strong-atomicity`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that Some arrow out of the evaluation object is not an epimorphism: two distinct arrows after it agree after it. Here: $1\circ h=k\circ h$, with $1\ne k$. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Fails Fregean Axiom.

The propositions $\top$ and $\{1\}$ are in the domain, the model being full; they are both true at the evaluation point and differ at the other arrow, so the Fregean Axiom fails.

*Source: Classicism, p. 61. General argument `arguments/nonidentity-arrow`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that Some arrow out of the evaluation object is not its identity. Here: The arrow $h:W_0\to W_1$. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Holds ND.

The action of an arrow out of the evaluation object is undone by the action of its retraction, so it is injective at every type, and ND holds there (Proposition 3.24(i)).

*Source: Classicism, §3.5, Proposition 3.24(i). General argument `arguments/retractions`. It requires that Every arrow out of the evaluation object has a retraction: an arrow back after which it composes to the identity. Here: The arrows out of $W_0$ are its identity and $h$, which $j$ retracts. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Holds Rigid Power, □Rigid Power.

Write $X_0(E)$ for the intension $k\mapsto k\cdot E$. The extension at an arrow $h$ of the power property $\lambda X\, .\,\operatorname{Rigid}(X)\land X\le F$ is the set of rigid $X$ with $X\le h\cdot F$, the bound variable ranging over the domain untransported and the parameter transported. By the condition the rigid relations are the $X_0(E)$, and $X_0(T)\le X_0(S)$ iff $T\subseteq S$; so for rigid $F=X_0(S)$ the power property has extension $\{X_0(T'):T'\subseteq k\cdot S\}$ at $k$, while transporting its extension at the identity along $k$ gives $\{X_0(k\cdot T):T\subseteq S\}$. These coincide, since every $T'\subseteq k\cdot S$ is $k\cdot T$ for $T:=\{s\in S:k\cdot s\in T'\}$. So the power property is itself $X_0$ of its extension, hence rigid, and the same at every reachable object gives the boxed form.

*General argument `arguments/rigid-power-tight`. It requires that At every object reachable from the evaluation point, the rigid relations of each relational type are exactly the intensions $k\mapsto k\cdot E$, the disjunctions of the haecceities of the members of $E$, for $E$ any set of tuples from the domains there; in particular every such intension is in the domain. Here: Every intension is present, so for any set $E$ the intension $k\mapsto k\cdot E$ is in the domain, and a relation is weakly inextensible at a world iff it lies below that intension over its extension there, since that is the smallest intension satisfying the hypothesis; with persistence, a rigid relation equals it (the argument deferred in extraction.md, 3 October 2026). By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), prompted by Cian Dorr, 3 October 2026 (full action models); extended by Claude Fable 5.1, prompted by Cian Dorr (Anthropic), 4 October 2026, at Cian Dorr's direction.*

*Revised 2026-10-04 by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The argument deferred in extraction.md on 3 October for the full action models, where every intension is present, stated under the condition it actually uses, which the symmetry-constrained full models also meet.

### Holds Necessity of Second-Order Analysis.

Let $v$ be any object reachable from the evaluation point and $\mathfrak R$ a real number structure at $v$ (Background, Analysis). Its completeness is tested against the subproperties of its carrier present at $v$, and by extensional fullness every subset of the carrier's extension there is the extension at the identity of one of them; so the carrier, with the extensions of $\le$, $+$ and $\times$, is a complete ordered field in the sense of the metatheory and, by Huntington's theorem, a theorem of ZF, is isomorphic to the real numbers. For the same reason the extension of $N$, the least subproperty containing $0$ and closed under adding $1$, is its set of natural numbers, that set being the extension of a subproperty. A second-order analytical sentence $A(\mathfrak R)$ quantifies over the relations among entities of the structure's type at $v$, applied to the structure's elements, and their extensions at the identity are all the relations on the carrier, again by extensional fullness. So $A(\mathfrak R)$ holds at $v$ exactly when $A$ holds in the real numbers under full second-order semantics, which depends neither on $v$ nor on $\mathfrak R$. Hence $\Box\forall\mathfrak R\,.\,\operatorname{Real}_\sigma(\mathfrak R)\to A(\mathfrak R)$ holds when $A$ is true of the reals and $\Box\forall\mathfrak R\,.\,\operatorname{Real}_\sigma(\mathfrak R)\to\neg A(\mathfrak R)$ when it is false: every instance of the Necessity of Second-Order Analysis holds, and with it the Necessity of Analysis and the Non-contingency of the Continuum Hypothesis, as recorded. No choice is used.

*General argument `arguments/second-order-analysis-extensionally-full`. It requires that The model is extensionally full at every object: every set of tuples from the domains at an object is the extension, at the identity arrow, of an element of the domain of the matching relational type there. Here: A full model contains every intension, so in particular one with any given extension at the identity. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Zachary Goodsell, 2026-10-23.*

### Fails No Contingency (signature Σ), Witnessed Possibility, Separated Structure, Independence (signature Σ), Maximalism (signature Σ).

No Contingency (signature Σ) fails, since the Σ-sentence $\forall\bar x\, .\,c\bar x$ denotes $a$, true and contingent; Witnessed Possibility fails for the pure formula $x=\top_\tau$, witnessed by $\top_\tau$, since $\Diamond(c=\top_\tau)$ is $\Diamond\Box a$ and $a$ is necessary at no world; Separated Structure fails with it, being equivalent to Possibly Witnessed Possibility; Independence (signature Σ) and Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ) fail through the other relational constants: such a constant $c'$ of type $\tau'$ denotes what the closed pure term $\top_{\tau'}$ denotes, and $c'=\top_{\tau'}$ is a true identity that C(Σ) does not prove. The designated constant refutes neither: closed pure terms denote entities fixed by every arrow (Classicism, §3.5, p. 58), whereas some arrow does not fix $a$, so no closed pure term denotes $\lambda\bar x\, .\,a$.

*General argument `arguments/sigma-true-atom`. It requires that Σ has a designated relational constant $c$ of type $\tau=\bar\sigma t$ denoting $\lambda\bar x\, .\,a$, where $a$ is the actual-world proposition, the unique true atom; every other constant, of which there is at least one, is relational and denotes the top element of its type. Here: This is the interpretation. It requires that The actual-world proposition $a$, the strongest truth, is in the domain; it is necessary at no world, and some arrow does not fix it. Here: The singleton $a$ of the identity arrow is in the domain, the model being full. It is necessary at no world: a world other than the identity sees itself, which lies outside $a$, and the identity sees an arrow other than itself. And a non-identity arrow $k$ does not fix it, since $1\in k\cdot a$ would need $1\circ k=1$. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr’s request, 2026-09-22.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The verbatim copies in ten records (finite-support, symmetric and full action models) stated once for the topic. Its B clause is now sigma-true-atom-b, which needs an arrow from which the actual world is out of reach. "$a$ is fixed by no arrow but the identity" became "some arrow does not fix $a$": in a symmetric model the actual-world proposition is the symmetry group, which its members fix, and the conclusion needs only the weaker claim.

### Fails Relational Choice.

At type $e$. The individuals, which every arrow fixes, are an unspecified infinite set, so here the union $D=\bigcup_n P_n$. Let $U$ relate each member of $P_n$ to the members of $P_{n+1}$; it is in the domain, the model being full, and serial. A functional subrelation would send each sock to a sock of the next pair, and iterated from one member of $P_0$ it would choose a sock from every pair.

*General argument `arguments/socks-relational-choice`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that At every object the individuals are the same infinite set, and every arrow acts on them as the identity. Here: This is the choice of individuals. It requires that The construction is carried out in ZF with a countable family $(P_n)_{n\in\omega}$ of pairwise disjoint two-element sets that has no choice function, and every infinite set the construction leaves unspecified is their union. Here: This is the hypothesis. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-08.*

### Holds Strong Actuality, □Strong Actuality.

Let $V$ be the evaluation object or the target of an arrow out of it, and $w:=\{1_V\}$, in the domain at $V$. It is true at $1_V$. Under an arrow $f$ out of $V$ it becomes $\{k : k\circ f=1_V\}$, the set of retractions of $f$, which has at most one member and so lies below $q$ or below $\neg q$ for every proposition $q$ at $f$'s target. So Strong Actuality holds at $1_V$. A closed sentence holds at an arrow iff it holds at the identity of the arrow's target, so Strong Actuality holds at every world after the evaluation point, and □Strong Actuality holds there.

*General argument `arguments/strong-actuality-unique-retractions`. It requires that At the evaluation object, and at the target of every arrow out of it, the singleton of the identity arrow is in the domain. Here: The singleton of the identity arrow at any object is in the domain, the model being full. It requires that At the evaluation object, and at the target of every arrow out of it, every arrow out of that object has at most one retraction. Here: Out of $W_0$, the identity has only itself as retraction and $h$ only $j$, the one arrow back. Out of $W_1$, the identity has only itself; $j$ has none, since $h\circ j=k\ne1$; and $k$ has none, since $1\circ k=k\circ k=k$.

## Notes

The cited construction is a model of the map’s relational-type framework. The description identifies its evaluation point; construction and verification are given at the PDF locations in References. Only the type-t ND assertion is recorded. Everything that implies these fails with them.

## History

The record's revision log before it was written as arguments.

- **2026-09-25** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Zachary Goodsell) — Added Transversal Choice, by the argument recorded for Relational Choice: a full model contains every intension, in particular one whose extension at the evaluation point is a transversal, chosen in the metatheory, of the extension there of an equivalence relation; the equivalence and transversal conditions are unboxed. Recorded on a question of Zachary Goodsell, after an observation of Christopher Sun. Now satisfies: Transversal Choice.
- **2026-09-25** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Cian Dorr) — Added Gallin Extensional Comprehension at W0, and the failure of the Infinity Schema and of Possible Infinity at type t; see the notes. Now satisfies: Gallin Extensional Comprehension. Now violates: Infinity Schema (type t), Possible Infinity (type t).
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Cian Dorr) — Recorded the Distinctness-preserving collapse; see the notes. Now violates: Truths are ND-necessary.
- **2026-09-22** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Cian Dorr) — Fixed an interpretation of Σ (relational constants as top, individual constants as one fixed individual) and recorded the signature schemata it refutes, at Cian Dorr’s request. Now violates: Witnessed Possibility, Separated Structure, Independence (signature Σ), Maximalism (signature Σ).
- **2026-09-22** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Cian Dorr) — Added the failure of Strong Atomicity (type t) at W0; see the notes. Now violates: Strong Atomicity (type t).
- **2026-09-22** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Cian Dorr) — Boxed the Relational Choice claim; see the notes. Now satisfies: □Relational Choice.
- **2026-09-20** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), prompted by Cian Dorr) — Added Relational Choice at Cian Dorr's direction. With choice in the metatheory a serial relation has a functional subrelation, and a full model contains every intension, so that subrelation is in the domain; see Classicism, p. 61, on the principles common to full models. Now satisfies: Relational Choice.
- **2026-09-17** (OpenAI Codex (GPT-6), prompted by Zachary Goodsell) — Adopted the source’s relational type system at the user’s request. The cited construction now directly supplies the recorded model; the former type-extension obligation is removed. Now satisfies: □Rigid Comprehension, □Atomicity, □Actuality, ND (type t), B for pure sentences. Now violates: □ND (type t), No Pure Contingency.
