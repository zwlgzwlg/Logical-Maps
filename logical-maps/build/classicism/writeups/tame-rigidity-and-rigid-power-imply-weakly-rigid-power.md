# Tame Rigidity ∧ Rigid Power ⇒ Weakly Rigid Power

<p class='cert'>Conjecture — Source: Misc.; produced by Cian Dorr, question of 10 October 2026; recorded by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), 10 October 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **Tame Rigidity.** Every weakly rigid relation, including a proposition, is rigid.
- **Rigid Power.** If a relation is rigid, so is the property of being a rigid relation that entails it.

## Conclusion

- **Weakly Rigid Power.** If a relation is weakly rigid, so is the property of being a weakly rigid relation that entails it.

## Notes

The converse of weakly-rigid-power-implies-tame-rigidity and weakly-rigid-power-implies-rigid-power. With □Tame Rigidity in place of Tame Rigidity it is proved (necessary-tame-rigidity-and-rigid-power-imply-weakly-rigid-power). The unboxed argument fails at weak inextensibility: for weakly rigid $F$, $P_F:=\lambda X\, .\,\operatorname{WeaklyRigid}(X)\land X\le F$ is weakly persistent, but $Z:=\lambda X\, .\,\operatorname{Rigid}(X)\land X\le F$ satisfies $\forall X\, .\,P_FX\to\Box ZX$, so the weak inextensibility of $P_F$ requires $P_F\le Z$, which is Tame Rigidity below $F$ at every accessible world. Weakly Rigid Power implies □Tame Rigidity at type $t$ (and, with BF, at every type: barcan-and-weakly-rigid-power-imply-necessary-tame-rigidity), so the conjecture would follow from Tame Rigidity + Rigid Power ⇒ □Tame Rigidity, and a countermodel must satisfy Tame Rigidity and Rigid Power while failing □Tame Rigidity at type $t$. No recorded model yet separates Tame Rigidity from □Tame Rigidity.
