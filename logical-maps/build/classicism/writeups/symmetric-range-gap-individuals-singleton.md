<p class='cert'>Model — Source: BC does not imply RC (draft); produced by Cian Dorr; recorded by Claude Opus 5 (Anthropic), 19 September 2026.</p>

## Package

- **Axiom of Infinity (type t).** There are not finitely many propositions. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **Actuality.** There is a true proposition that entails every true proposition.
- **Boolean Completeness.** Every property of entities of a relational type has a greatest lower bound in that type.
- **Distinctness-preserving collapse.** Every truth is necessary under the distinctness-preserving modality.
- **No Pure Contingency.** Each closed sentence of the pure language, if true, is necessary. This is a sentence schema, not a quantifier over propositions.
- **Tame Rigidity.** Every weakly rigid relation, including a proposition, is rigid.
- **No Contingency (signature Σ).** Each closed sentence of the language of the fixed signature Sigma, if true, is necessary. A sentence schema, standing to No Pure Contingency as Possibility Maximalism (signature Σ) stands to Possibility Maximalism (pure).
- **B for sentences of Σ.** The B instance for every closed sentence of the language of the fixed signature Sigma.
- **¬ Atomicity (type t).** Atomicity (type t) in the displayed closed propositional formulation.
- **¬ BF (type t).** BF (type t) in the displayed closed propositional formulation.
- **¬ Axiom of Infinity (type e).** There are not finitely many individuals. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **¬ Infinity Schema (type e).** There are arbitrarily many pairwise distinct entities of this fixed type; one sentence for each positive integer n.
- **¬ Possible Infinity (type e).** Possibly there are not finitely many individuals: the Axiom of Infinity at this type, under a diamond.
- **¬ Witnessed Possibility.** For pure-formulas P with free variables among a finite tuple x, and distinct matching nonlogical constants c, a witness to P entails that P at those constants is possible.
- **¬ Separated Structure.** For each typed nonlogical constant c and closed same-typed terms F,G not containing c, equality after application to c implies equality of F and G.
- **¬ Independence (signature Σ).** No constant of Sigma is a pure operation applied to other constants: for a closed pure term A and distinct constants c, d_1,…,d_n with n ≥ 0, c differs from A applied to the d’s. With n = 0, no constant denotes a pure entity.
- **¬ Maximalism (signature Σ).** The Maximalism schema for the fixed nonlogical signature Σ: every closed identity of its language not provable in C(Σ) is false.

## Definition

A symmetric ideally-full intensional action model over one object, the set of natural numbers. Its symmetry group is the permutations fixing a distinguished individual, and its arrows are those permutations together with all the functions that omit the distinguished individual from their range. The evaluation point is the identity arrow.

Individuals, fixed for this record: there is a single individual at every object. The arrows still act on the base as the construction says, and the base still supplies the pinning sets and the symmetry groups.

Interpretation of Σ, fixed for this record: every constant of Σ is relational, and each denotes the top element of its type.

*A member of the group Symmetric ideally-full models, which supplies this definition with the record's settings, and the arguments marked as shared.*

## Arguments

### Fails Atomicity (type t).

The symmetry group is an atom, but no atom lies inside the nonempty proposition $T$ of arrows omitting $0$ from their range, which is symmetric and pinned down by $\{0\}$: a nonempty symmetric $p\subseteq T$ pinned down by $N\ni0$ and containing $h$ contains every arrow in $T$ whose restriction to $N$ has the same fibres as $h$’s, and those whose restriction to $N\cup\{m\}$ has the same fibres as $h$’s form a smaller nonempty symmetric proposition pinned down by $N\cup\{m\}$, since $h$’s value at a fresh $m$ can be made to coincide with, or to differ from, a value on $N$.

*By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-23.*

### Holds Axiom of Infinity (type t).

The propositions $C_{n,m}:=\{h : hn=hm\}$, that an arrow collapses $n$ and $m$, are symmetric, since relabelling the individuals of a world by a member of the symmetry group keeps identities among them, and each is pinned down by $\{n,m\}$; by the condition infinitely many of them are pairwise distinct, so there are infinitely many propositions. The set of numerals at type $t$ is fixed by every arrow, hence symmetric and pinned down by the empty set, so finite cardinality is standard and no finite cardinality holds of the universal property.

*From the group *Symmetric ideally-full models*, shared argument `symmetric-ideally-full#axiom-of-infinity-t`. It requires that There are infinitely many pairs of individuals such that, for any two of these pairs, some arrow collapses the one and not the other. Here: The pairs $\{n,m\}$ of positive numbers: a function omitting $0$ from its range that collapses $n$ with $m$ and nothing else is an arrow. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-02.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Replaces the members' argument of 20 September (Claude Fable 5.1), which used the propositions $\{h : hn=n\}$ that an arrow fixes a given individual. Those are not symmetric when the symmetry group moves $n$: symmetry asks that $h\in p$ imply $g\circ h\in p$, and $(g\circ h)n=gn$.

### Holds Actuality.

The symmetry group is the smallest symmetric set of arrows containing the identity, and by the condition it is pinned down by a finite set, so it is a proposition in the domain, and an atom entailing every truth.

*Source: Boolean Completeness does not imply Rigid Comprehension, Proposition 24, p. 13; §7.1, p. 21; §8, pp. 23–26. From the group *Symmetric ideally-full models*, shared argument `symmetric-ideally-full#actuality`. It requires that The symmetry group, the smallest symmetric set of arrows containing the identity, is pinned down by a finite set. Here: The two classes of arrows are told apart by an arrow's value at the distinguished individual. By Cian Dorr, 2026-09-19.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The three members' versions stated once; what pins the group down is each member's reason for meeting symmetry-group-pinned.

### Holds Boolean Completeness.

At every relational type: a property $F$ of type-$\tau$ entities has a least upper bound, the union of the hulls of its instances. Let $F$ be pinned down by $N\supseteq M_0$. For each instance $u$ of $F$ at the identity, its hull is the closure of $u$ under the arrows that $N$ does not separate from the identity, transported along the arrows agreeing with the identity on $N$; it is symmetric, pinned down by $N$ (by (B1), which splices an arrow agreeing with $h'$ on the instance's pinning set with $h$ on $N$), and an upper bound of $u$. Every upper bound $z$ of all the instances, pinned down by $N'$, contains every hull: given a member of a hull, (B2) supplies a symmetry fixing $N$ and moving the instance's pinning set off $N'$, whose image is again an instance (by the orbit lemma, Lemma 35), lying under $z$; and $z$, pinned down by $N'$, cannot tell the moved instance's tuple from the original. The union of the hulls is pinned down by $N$ and symmetric, so it is in the domain, and it is the least upper bound.

*Source: Boolean Completeness does not imply Rigid Comprehension, Theorem 36, p. 18; Corollary 37, p. 19. From the group *Symmetric ideally-full models*, shared argument `symmetric-ideally-full#boolean-completeness`. It requires that There is a finite set $M_0$ of individuals at the evaluation object such that: (B1) for every finite $M\supseteq M_0$ and every arrow $h$ from the evaluation object to itself that $M$ does not separate (some arrow $k\notin G$ agrees with $h$ on $M$, or $h\in G$), every arrow $h'$ agreeing with $h$ on $M$, and finite $P,Q$ with $P\cap Q\subseteq M$, some arrow agrees with $h'$ on $P$ and with $h$ on $Q$; and (B2) for finite $N\supseteq M_0$ and finite $P,Q$, some member of the symmetry group fixes $N$ pointwise and moves every member of $P$ outside $N$ off $Q$. The arrows in (B1) go from the evaluation object to any one object, and $M$ separates $h$ when every arrow agreeing with $h$ on $M$ is a member of the symmetry group of the evaluation object. These are the hypotheses of Dorr's main theorem (draft, Definitions 28–30, Theorem 36). Here: With $M_0=\{0\}$, the distinguished individual (the draft's argument for this model). Moving points off a finite set can be done by a permutation fixing that individual; an arrow that $M_0$ does not separate omits $0$ from its range, as does any arrow agreeing with it at $0$, so a prescription taken from the two of them extends by nonzero values to an arrow of that kind. By Cian Dorr, 2026-09-19.*

*Revised 2026-10-06 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The draft's main theorem, which the all-surjections and collapse-pair models each applied in an argument of their own, stated once; what each member does to meet its hypotheses is its reason for meeting hull-conditions. Proved in Lean (SymBase.lub_of_hull).

*Revised 2026-10-06 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* No longer requires one-object-action-model: as the draft notes (proof of Proposition 40), nothing in the theorem uses a single object, pinning, separation, amalgamability and hulls all quantifying over arrows with a fixed target; the condition hull-conditions now says so.

### Fails BF (type t).

In a one-object finitely pinned model, BF (type t) fails as soon as there are a finite $N$, an arrow $i$ and a proposition $q$ in the domain that is the transport $i^{\prime}\cdot p=\{k : k\circ i^{\prime}\in p\}$ of no proposition $p$ along any arrow $i^{\prime}$ agreeing with $i$ on $N$: the intension $X:=\{\langle r,j\rangle : r\ne q\text{ or }j\text{ disagrees with }i\text{ on }N\}$, which the condition puts in the domain, contains $\langle i^{\prime}\cdot p,i^{\prime}\rangle$ for every $p$ and $i^{\prime}$, so $\forall p\, .\,\Box Xp$ holds at the identity, and omits $\langle q,i\rangle$, so $\Box\forall p\, .\,Xp$ fails there. Since membership of $k$ in $i^{\prime}\cdot p$ depends only on $k$ restricted to the range of $i^{\prime}$, it suffices that $q$ separate two arrows agreeing on every such range, as the condition provides.

*General argument `arguments/barcan-t-transport`. It requires that The model is a one-object action model whose entities are finitely pinned, and there are a finite set $N$, an arrow $i$ and a proposition $q$ in the domain such that $q$ separates two arrows that agree on the range of every arrow agreeing with $i$ on $N$, and the intension $\{\langle r,j\rangle : r\ne q\text{ or }j\text{ disagrees with }i\text{ on }N\}$ is in the domain. Here: Take $N=\{0\}$, $i$ any arrow with $i0\ne0$, so that every arrow agreeing with it on $N$ omits $0$ from its range, and $q:=\{k : k0=0\}$, the symmetry group, pinned down by $\{0\}$ and symmetric: a permutation $k$ fixing $0$ and the arrow $k^{\prime}$ agreeing with it off $0$ but sending $0$ elsewhere, which omits $0$ from its range, are separated by $q$. The intension the argument uses is pinned down by $N$, and symmetric, since $g\cdot q=q$ for $g$ fixing $0$ and $(g\circ j)0=0$ iff $j0=0$, so it lies in the domain. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), answering Cian Dorr’s question whether the failure of BF sharpens to type $t$, 2026-09-23.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The finite-support group's argument and the symmetric range-gap models' copies stated once for the topic; that $X$ is in the domain (pinned down by $N$, and in a symmetric model symmetric) is now part of each record's reason for meeting transport-gap.

### Holds Distinctness-preserving collapse.

For a true $p$, $a\le p$, since $a$ entails every truth. Take $q:=a$ in the definition of $\Box_{\ne}p$: at a world in $a$, $p$ holds; at a world outside $a$, $\Diamond a$ fails. So every truth is $\Box_{\ne}$-necessary.

*General argument `arguments/dpc-isolated-actual-world`. It requires that The actual-world proposition $a$ is in the domain and entails every truth, and no world outside $a$ sees a world in $a$. Here: The actual-world proposition is the set of arrows that are permutations, pinned down by $\{0\}$; no composite with an arrow omitting $0$ from its range is a permutation, since the other arrows fix $0$ and so cannot restore it to the range. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-23.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The finite-support, symmetric and full action models' copies (eight records) stated once for the topic; what varied, why no world outside the actual world sees back into it, is each record's reason for meeting actual-world-isolated.

### Holds No Pure Contingency.

Closed pure terms denote entities fixed by every arrow (§3.5, p. 58). With a single object, a proposition fixed by every arrow contains every arrow if it contains the identity and no arrow otherwise, so a true closed pure sentence is necessary: the source's one-object No Pure Contingency observation (p. 79), applied to each closed instance.

*Source: Classicism, §3.5, p. 58; p. 79. General argument `arguments/no-pure-contingency-one-object`. It requires that The model is an action model (Classicism, Appendix D), or an intensional action model in the sense of Dorr's draft (Boolean Completeness does not imply Rigid Comprehension), with a single object. Here: It has one object (Dorr, draft, §3.1: closed pure terms denote entities fixed by every arrow). By Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr, 2026-09-17.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Moved from the group finite-support-one-object to the topic, for every one-object action model; the reason the source's observation holds is spelled out in place of "Boxed positive flags use the source’s explicit one-object No Pure Contingency observation, applied separately to each closed instance."

### Fails Axiom of Infinity (type e), Infinity Schema (type e), Possible Infinity (type e).

No two individuals are distinct, and the numeral $\operatorname{Suc}_e\mathbf{0}_e$ holds of the universal property at type $e$ at every world.

*General argument `arguments/one-individual`. It requires that There is exactly one individual, at every world. Here: There is a single individual at every object. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-02.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Moved from the group finite-support-one-object to the topic.

### Fails Witnessed Possibility, Separated Structure, Independence (signature Σ), Maximalism (signature Σ).

Let $c\in\Sigma$ have relational type $\tau$, so $c=\top_\tau$ necessarily. Witnessed Possibility fails for the pure formula $x\ne\top_\tau$, witnessed by $\bot_\tau$ but impossible of $c$; Separated Structure fails since $\lambda x\, .\,x$ and $\lambda x\, .\,\top_\tau$ agree on $c$ and differ; Independence (signature Σ) fails since $c$ denotes what the closed pure term $\top_\tau$ denotes; Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ) fails since $c=\top_\tau$ is a true identity that C(Σ) does not prove.

*General argument `arguments/sigma-top`. It requires that Every constant of Σ is relational, and each denotes the top element of its type. Here: This is the interpretation. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr’s request, 2026-09-22.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Moved from the group finite-support-one-object to the topic; it uses nothing about the model.

### Holds Tame Rigidity.

Write $B_N(E)$ for the intension $k\mapsto\bigcup\{k^{\prime}\cdot E:k^{\prime}\text{ agrees with }k \text{ on }N\}$; it is pinned down by $N$, and symmetric when the model is, since the symmetry group consists of arrows and $(gk)\cdot E=g\cdot(k\cdot E)$, so it is in the domain. (1) A relation $Y$ pinned down by $S$, with extension $E$ at the identity, is weakly rigid iff $Y=B_S(E)=B_N(E)$ for every finite $N\supseteq S$: weak persistence gives $k\cdot E\subseteq Y_k$, and with pinning $B_S(E)\subseteq Y$; a domain element $X$ with $\Box X$ true of each member of $E$, pinned down by $N$, contains $B_N(E)$, so weak inextensibility says exactly that $Y\subseteq B_N(E)$ for every finite $N$, and $B_N(E)\subseteq B_S(E)$ for $N\supseteq S$. (2) Rigidity is (1) at every world: for each arrow $h$, $h\cdot Y$, with $(h\cdot Y)_k=Y_{kh}$, must satisfy $k\cdot Y_h\subseteq Y_{kh}\subseteq B_N(Y_h)_k$ for all $k$ and finite $N$. (3) Let $Y$ be weakly rigid. Persistence at $h$: $k\cdot Y_h=\bigcup\{(kk^{\prime\prime})\cdot E:k^{\prime\prime}\text{ agrees with }h\text{ on }S\}\subseteq B_S(E)_{kh}=Y_{kh}$. Inextensibility at $h$: given $N$, take $N^{\prime\prime}$ from the condition. By (1), $Y_{kh}=B_{N^{\prime\prime}}(E)_{kh}$, so a member of it is $k^{\prime}\cdot e$ with $e\in E$, pinned down by some finite $M$, and $k^{\prime}$ agreeing with $kh$ on $N^{\prime\prime}$. The condition gives $k^{\prime\prime}$ agreeing with $h$ on $N^{\prime\prime}$ and $j$ agreeing with $k$ on $N$ with $jk^{\prime\prime}$ agreeing with $k^{\prime}$ on $M$, so $k^{\prime}\cdot e=j\cdot(k^{\prime\prime}\cdot e)$, where $k^{\prime\prime}\cdot e\in B_{N^{\prime\prime}}(E)_h=Y_h$; hence $k^{\prime}\cdot e\in B_N(Y_h)_k$. So every weakly rigid relation, at every type, is rigid. With No Pure Contingency, which holds in one-object models, the map's results give $\Box$Tame Rigidity.

*General argument `arguments/tame-rigidity-factorizable`. It requires that The model is an action model (Classicism, Appendix D), or an intensional action model in the sense of Dorr's draft (Boolean Completeness does not imply Rigid Comprehension), with a single object. Here: It has one object (Dorr, draft, §3.1: closed pure terms denote entities fixed by every arrow). It requires that Write an entity of relational type at the evaluation object as its intension $k\mapsto Y_k$ over the arrows $k$ out of it, so that $Y\bar a$ holds at $k$ iff $k\cdot\bar a\in Y_k$; $Y$ is pinned down by a finite set $N$ of the points the arrows act on when $Y_k=Y_{k^{\prime}}$ for any arrows $k,k^{\prime}$ agreeing on $N$. Every entity in a domain is pinned down by a finite set, in the sense that $k\cdot x=k^{\prime}\cdot x$ for arrows agreeing on it, and the domain of each relational type at the evaluation object holds every intension pinned down by a finite set (in a symmetric model, every symmetric one). Here: A relational domain holds exactly the symmetric intensions pinned down by a finite set, and every individual $n$ is pinned down by $\{n\}$. It requires that For every arrow $h$ out of the evaluation object and finite sets $N,S$ there is a finite $N^{\prime\prime}\supseteq S$ such that, whenever $k^{\prime}$ agrees with $k\circ h$ on $N^{\prime\prime}$, for every finite $M$ some arrows $k^{\prime\prime}$ agreeing with $h$ on $N^{\prime\prime}$ and $j$ agreeing with $k$ on $N$ have $j\circ k^{\prime\prime}$ agreeing with $k^{\prime}$ on $M$. Here: Put the distinguished individual $d$ in $S$ and $N$, take $N^{\prime\prime}:=S$ and, enlarging $N$, assume $h(N^{\prime\prime})\subseteq N$. An arrow's value at $d$ tells its kind: a permutation fixing $d$, or a map omitting $d$; so $k^{\prime}$ has the kind of $kh$, and $k^{\prime\prime}$ and $j$ will have the kinds of $h$ and $k$. Let $k^{\prime\prime}$ agree with $h$ on $N^{\prime\prime}$; for $m\in M\setminus N^{\prime\prime}$ let $k^{\prime\prime}m:=k^{-1}(k^{\prime}m)$ if $k$ is a permutation and $k^{\prime}m\in k(N)$, and otherwise a fresh point outside $N\cup\{d\}$, one for each $m$ if $h$ is a permutation and one for each value of $k^{\prime}$ if not. Let $j$ agree with $k$ on $N$ and send each fresh point to its value. Since $k^{\prime}m\ne d$ for $m\ne d$, $k^{\prime\prime}m\ne d$; where $h$ is a permutation so is $k^{\prime}$ or $k$ omits $d$, and $k^{\prime\prime}$ is injective on $M$; where $k$ is a permutation the new values of $j$ lie outside $k(N)$ and are distinct. So both extend to arrows of their kinds, and $jk^{\prime\prime}$ agrees with $k^{\prime}$ on $M$. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), on Cian Dorr's request to settle Tame Rigidity where it was open, 2026-10-09.*

### Holds No Contingency (signature Σ), B for sentences of Σ.

Each constant of Σ denotes what the closed pure term $\top_\tau$ of its type denotes, so a closed sentence of the language of Σ denotes what the pure sentence with $\top_\tau$ in place of each constant denotes; if true it is necessary by No Pure Contingency, which holds here. So No Contingency (signature Σ) holds, and B for sentences of Σ with it: a true Σ-sentence is necessary, hence necessarily possible.

*General argument `arguments/sigma-top-npc`. It requires that Every constant of Σ is relational, and each denotes the top element of its type. Here: This is the interpretation. By Cian Dorr (observation); recorded by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), 2026-10-02.*

*Revised 2026-10-03 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The argument sigma-single-top, for Σ a single constant of type $t$ denoting $\top$, stated for every interpretation of Σ by top elements, now that such interpretations have no individual constants. It replaces that argument and nc-sigma-homogeneous, which reached the same verdicts through an individual constant when the model's automorphisms carry every individual to every other. With an individual constant and no such automorphisms the verdicts were unknown in 19 models, and nowhere did the individual constants settle a verdict differently.


## Notes

The first of the draft's two variants in which BF is made to fail. Actuality and the range deficiency come from the same finite test here, which is what the next variant prises apart. Atomicity and Rigid Comprehension are not settled in the draft and are left unknown. The source is a work in progress. Everything that implies these fails with them.

## History

The record's revision log before it was written as arguments.

- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Recorded the Distinctness-preserving collapse; see the notes. Now satisfies: Distinctness-preserving collapse.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Re-fixed the interpretation of Σ so as to settle No Contingency (signature Σ) and B for sentences of Σ, at Cian Dorr’s request; see the notes. Now violates: No Contingency (signature Σ), B for sentences of Σ.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Corrected the reason given for the failures of Independence (signature Σ) and Distinctness (signature Σ): the true atom is denoted by no closed pure term, since such terms denote entities fixed by every arrow; the failures come from the other relational constants, which denote top. No verdict changes.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Recorded the failure of Relational Choice, at types (e→t) and e: a functional subrelation of the serial relation pairing each property with its members would be symmetric and finitely pinned, and a symmetry fixing its pinning set would carry its choice for the property of lying outside that set to a second choice. Cian Dorr’s observation that a choice cannot be finitely pinned; argument in the notes. Now violates: Relational Choice.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Recorded the failure of BF at type t, sharpening the failure of BF; argument in the notes. Now violates: BF (type t).
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Recorded the failure of Atomicity (type t), and with it of the Strong Leibniz Biconditionals; see the notes. Now violates: Atomicity (type t).
- **2026-09-22** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Fixed an interpretation of Σ (relational constants as top, individual constants as one fixed individual) and recorded the signature schemata it refutes, at Cian Dorr’s request. Now violates: Witnessed Possibility, Separated Structure, Independence (signature Σ), Maximalism (signature Σ).
- **2026-09-20** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added both Axioms of Infinity at Cian Dorr's direction. The individuals are the natural numbers and identity at the identity arrow is literal, so no numeral counts them. The propositions that a given individual is fixed by the arrow, one for each individual, are pairwise distinct, symmetric and pinned by that individual, so there are infinitely many propositions. The set of numerals at each type is invariant under every arrow, hence symmetric and pinned by the empty set, so finite cardinality is standard and no finite cardinality holds of the universal property at either type. Now satisfies: Axiom of Infinity (type e), Axiom of Infinity (type t).
