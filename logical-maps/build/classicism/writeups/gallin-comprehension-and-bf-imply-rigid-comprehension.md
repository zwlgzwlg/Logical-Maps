# Gallin Extensional Comprehension ∧ BF ⇒ Rigid Comprehension

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Classicism (2024), Lean `Classicism.Map.gallin_comprehension_and_bf_imply_rigid_comprehension`; produced by Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr; recorded by OpenAI Codex (GPT-6), 17 September 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **Gallin Extensional Comprehension.** Every relation is coextensive with one that is persistent and has a persistent pointwise negation. This is the source’s comparison with Gallin’s different rigidity convention.
- **BF.** The Barcan Formula at every type. The predicate formulation closes the formula schema using lambda abstraction.

## Conclusion

- **Rigid Comprehension.** Every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a rigid one.

## Proof

The source states that, under BF, persistence of a relation and of its negation implies its inextensibility. Given pointwise necessary consequences on its instances, the persistent complement makes all non-instance cases necessary too; BF assembles the resulting pointwise necessary conditional into entailment. Use the Gallin-rigid coextension, which is then rigid in the source’s sense. Inextensibility is a boxed condition, so the assembly has to be available at every world. The plain premise supplies that, because Gallin Extensional Comprehension gives ND, ND with BF gives □ND, and □ND gives □BF, each a recorded result; both persistence conditions of the witness are boxed already.

## Notes

The source’s note states the predicate implication. This record applies it to the same comprehension witness; no converse is inferred. The part of the argument that uses BF only at the world of evaluation yields weak rigidity and is recorded separately as gallin-comprehension-and-bf-imply-weak-rigid-comprehension.

## Revisions

- **2026-09-20** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction) — Spelled out why the plain BF premise suffices although inextensibility carries a leading box: the argument needs BF at every world, and the premises deliver □BF through ND, □ND and the recorded C5 ⇒ □BF. Premises and conclusion unchanged.
