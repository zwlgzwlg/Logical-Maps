<p class='cert'>Model — Source: Classicism (2024); produced by Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr; recorded by OpenAI Codex (GPT-6), 17 September 2026.</p>

## Package

- **Distinctness-preserving collapse.** Every truth is necessary under the distinctness-preserving modality.
- **Axiom of Infinity (type e).** There are not finitely many individuals. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **□Atomicity.** Necessarily, every non-bottom entity of each relational type has an atom below it.
- **□Rigid Comprehension.** Necessarily, every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a rigid one.
- **Infinity Schema (type e).** There are arbitrarily many pairwise distinct entities of this fixed type; one sentence for each positive integer n.
- **□Intensional Choice.** Every closed instance of Intensional Choice is necessary. Box the entire object-variable closure; retain the same type range and other schema side conditions.
- **No Pure Contingency.** Each closed sentence of the pure language, if true, is necessary. This is a sentence schema, not a quantifier over propositions.
- **□Relational Choice.** Necessarily, every serial binary relation has a functional subrelation.
- **Relational Choice.** Every serial binary relation has a functional subrelation.
- **Rigid Power.** If a relation is rigid, so is the property of being a rigid relation that entails it.
- **□Rigid Power.** Every closed instance of Rigid Power is necessary. Box the entire object-variable closure; retain the same type range and other schema side conditions.
- **Transversal Choice.** Every equivalence relation, at any type including e, has a transversal, that is, a property with exactly one instance in each of its cells.
- **¬ Possible Infinity (type t).** Possibly there are not finitely many propositions: the Axiom of Infinity at this type, under a diamond.
- **¬ Infinity Schema (type t).** There are arbitrarily many pairwise distinct entities of this fixed type; one sentence for each positive integer n.
- **¬ Axiom of Infinity (type t).** There are not finitely many propositions. No finite cardinality holds of the universal property, so the domain of the type cannot be exhausted by finitely many steps from the empty property.
- **¬ Strong Leibniz Biconditionals (type t).** The type-t instance of the Strong Leibniz Biconditionals: every possible proposition is entailed by a strong world proposition, one that is possible and necessarily entails every proposition or its negation.
- **¬ Fregean Axiom.** Materially equivalent propositions are identical.
- **¬ B for sentences of Σ.** The B instance for every closed sentence of the language of the fixed signature Sigma.
- **¬ No Contingency (signature Σ).** Each closed sentence of the language of the fixed signature Sigma, if true, is necessary. A sentence schema, standing to No Pure Contingency as Possibility Maximalism (signature Σ) stands to Possibility Maximalism (pure).
- **¬ Witnessed Possibility.** For pure-formulas P with free variables among a finite tuple x, and distinct matching nonlogical constants c, a witness to P entails that P at those constants is possible.
- **¬ Separated Structure.** For each typed nonlogical constant c and closed same-typed terms F,G not containing c, equality after application to c implies equality of F and G.
- **¬ Independence (signature Σ).** No constant of Sigma is a pure operation applied to other constants: for a closed pure term A and distinct constants c, d_1,…,d_n with n ≥ 0, c differs from A applied to the d’s. With n = 0, no constant denotes a pure entity.
- **¬ Maximalism (signature Σ).** The Maximalism schema for the fixed nonlogical signature Σ: every closed identity of its language not provable in C(Σ) is false.
- **¬ ND (type t).** ND (type t) in the displayed closed propositional formulation.

## Definition

The full model on {1,k} with k²=k, evaluated at its sole object.

Individuals, fixed for this record: at every object the individuals are the natural numbers, and every arrow acts on them as the identity.

Interpretation of Σ, fixed for this record: one designated relational constant $c$ of type $\tau=\bar\sigma t$ denotes $\lambda\bar x\, .\,a$, where $a$ is the unique true atom of the model, the actual-world proposition $\{1\}$; every other constant of Σ, of which there is at least one, is relational and denotes the top element of its type.

Metatheory, fixed for this record: the axiom of choice is used freely, as in ordinary mathematics in ZFC, or in Lean's classical type theory for the verdicts certified there.

*A member of the group Full action models, which supplies this definition with the record's settings, and the arguments marked as shared.*

## Arguments

### Holds Distinctness-preserving collapse.

For a true $p$, $a\le p$, since $a$ entails every truth. Take $q:=a$ in the definition of $\Box_{\ne}p$: at a world in $a$, $p$ holds; at a world outside $a$, $\Diamond a$ fails. So every truth is $\Box_{\ne}$-necessary.

*General argument `arguments/dpc-isolated-actual-world`. It requires that The actual-world proposition $a$ is in the domain and entails every truth, and no world outside $a$ sees a world in $a$. Here: The actual-world proposition $\{1\}$ is in the domain, the model being full; under $k$, $x\circ k=k$ for both arrows, so no world outside it sees it. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-23.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The finite-support, symmetric and full action models' copies (eight records) stated once for the topic; what varied, why no world outside the actual world sees back into it, is each record's reason for meeting actual-world-isolated.

### Fails Possible Infinity (type t).

At a world with $n$ propositions, the numeral $\operatorname{Suc}^n_t\mathbf{0}_t$, a finite cardinality, holds of the universal property of propositions, so the Axiom of Infinity at type $t$ fails there. It fails at every world, so Possible Infinity at type $t$ fails.

*General argument `arguments/finitely-many-propositions-everywhere`. It requires that There are finitely many propositions at every object reachable from the evaluation point. Here: There is one object, with four propositions, the sets of the two arrows. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Fails Infinity Schema (type t), Axiom of Infinity (type t).

The propositions at the evaluation world are finitely many, and every intension of a full model is present, so the numerals are the finite cardinalities and one of them holds of the universal property of propositions: the Axiom of Infinity at type t fails, as does an instance of the schema.

*General argument `arguments/finitely-many-propositions`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that There are finitely many propositions at the evaluation world. Here: The propositions at the evaluation object are the subsets of the two arrows out of it, four in all. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-09-20.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The copies in three full action models (each with four propositions) stated once for the topic; each record's count is its reason for meeting finitely-many-propositions.

*Revised 2026-10-06 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The Axiom of Infinity's failure, which the text states, recorded as a verdict of its own, so that it is certified without the result that the Axiom implies the schema.

### Holds Axiom of Infinity (type e).

The individuals at the evaluation object are an infinite set and identity there is literal. The numerals at type $e$ are intensions of a full model, so they are the finite cardinalities, and none of them holds of the universal property: no finite cardinality holds of an infinite set. This is the argument the full surjection-monoid record gave for its own infinite individuals.

*General argument `arguments/fixed-infinite-individuals`. It requires that At every object the individuals are the same infinite set, and every arrow acts on them as the identity. Here: This is the choice of individuals. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-03.*

### Holds □Atomicity.

Entailment is inclusion of intensions. Below a relation $Y\ne\bot_\tau$ lies the relation whose intension is the singleton of one of $Y$'s tuples, which is in the domain since the model is full, and is an atom: its only proper part is $\bot_\tau$. Every object being full, the same holds at every arrow, so Atomicity is necessary. The source notes that full models are atomic (p. 61); stated once for the topic, in place of the full models' own arguments.

*Source: Classicism, p. 61. General argument `arguments/full-atomicity`. It requires that The model is a full action model: an action model (Classicism, Appendix D) that is full at every object. Here: An action model, full at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59; Appendix D). By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Holds □Rigid Comprehension.

Given $X$ of type $\tau$ at an object $W$, let $Y$ be the relation whose extension at an arrow $i$ out of $W$ is $X$'s extension at $W$ transported along $i$, which is in the domain since the model is full. It is coextensive with $X$. It is persistent, since its extension at $i\circ j$ is its extension at $i$ transported along $j$. And it is inextensible: if $\Box X'$ holds at $i$ of everything $Y$ holds of there, then at $i\circ j$ everything $Y$ holds of is the transport along $j$ of something $Y$ holds of at $i$, of which $X'$ then holds. Every object being full, the same holds at every arrow, so Rigid Comprehension is necessary. The source notes that full models satisfy it (p. 61); stated once for the topic, in place of the full models' own arguments.

*Source: Classicism, p. 61. General argument `arguments/full-rigid-comprehension`. It requires that The model is a full action model: an action model (Classicism, Appendix D) that is full at every object. Here: An action model, full at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59; Appendix D). By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Holds Axiom of Infinity (type e), Infinity Schema (type e).

The Infinity schema holds, there being $n$ distinct individuals for every $n$. For the Axiom: by extensional fullness the domain has a property of cardinalities true of $Z$ exactly when every property $Z$ holds of has a finite extension. It holds of $\mathbf{0}_e$, which holds only of empty properties, and passes from $Y$ to $\operatorname{Suc}_e Y$, which holds of $F$ only if $Y$ holds of $F$ less one of its instances. So every finite cardinality has it, and none holds of the universal property, whose extension is infinite.

*General argument `arguments/infinitely-many-individuals`. It requires that The model is extensionally full at every object: every set of tuples from the domains at an object is the extension, at the identity arrow, of an element of the domain of the matching relational type there. Here: A full model contains every intension, so in particular one with any given extension at the identity. It requires that There are infinitely many individuals at the evaluation world. Here: The individuals are the natural numbers. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Holds □Intensional Choice.

For each object $U$ and type $\sigma$ fix a well-ordering $<_U$ of the domain $D^\sigma_U$, and let $W$ be the intension of type $\sigma\to\sigma\to t$ with $W(h):={<_{\operatorname{cod}h}}$. Its value depends only on the arrow's codomain, so by the condition it is in the domain, and at every world its extension well-orders that world's type-$\sigma$ domain. Given $F$ with $\Box\exists x\, .\,Fx$, put $G:=\lambda x\, .\,Fx\land\forall y\, .\,(Fy\to\neg Wyx)$, the $W$-least $F$. It is definable from $F$ and $W$, so in the domain; $G\le F$, and its extension at every arrow is the singleton of the least element of $F$'s. So Intensional Choice holds, and the same at every reachable object gives $\Box$Intensional Choice. Cian Dorr's observation that such models are qualitatively full, made precise.

*General argument `arguments/intensional-choice-well-ordering`. It requires that At every object reachable from the evaluation point, the domain contains every intension whose value at an arrow depends only on the arrow's codomain. Here: The domains are full at every object. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's suggestion, 2026-10-03.*

### Holds No Pure Contingency.

Closed pure terms denote entities fixed by every arrow (§3.5, p. 58). With a single object, a proposition fixed by every arrow contains every arrow if it contains the identity and no arrow otherwise, so a true closed pure sentence is necessary: the source's one-object No Pure Contingency observation (p. 79), applied to each closed instance.

*Source: Classicism, §3.5, p. 58; p. 79. General argument `arguments/no-pure-contingency-one-object`. It requires that The model is an action model (Classicism, Appendix D), or an intensional action model in the sense of Dorr's draft (Boolean Completeness does not imply Rigid Comprehension), with a single object. Here: It has one object. By Andrew Bacon and Cian Dorr, 2026-09-17.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Moved from the group finite-support-one-object to the topic, for every one-object action model; the reason the source's observation holds is spelled out in place of "Boxed positive flags use the source’s explicit one-object No Pure Contingency observation, applied separately to each closed instance."

### Fails Strong Leibniz Biconditionals (type t).

Let $k$ out of the evaluation object have distinct $j\ne j^{\prime}$ after it with $j\circ k= j^{\prime}\circ k$. The proposition $\{j\circ k\}$, in the domain since the model is full, is possible, and the only possible proposition below it is itself. It is not a strong world: under $k$ it becomes $\{m : m\circ k=j\circ k\}$, which contains $j$ and $j^{\prime}$, and the proposition $\{j\}$ at $k$'s target, in the domain there, neither contains nor excludes it. So the type-$t$ Strong Leibniz Biconditionals fail. (The idempotent monoid's and the retract's own arguments of 22–23 September, stated once.)

*General argument `arguments/nonepic-strong-leibniz`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that Some arrow out of the evaluation object is not an epimorphism: two distinct arrows after it agree after it. Here: $1\cdot k=k\cdot k$, with $1\ne k$. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Fails Fregean Axiom.

The propositions $\top$ and $\{1\}$ are in the domain, the model being full; they are both true at the evaluation point and differ at the other arrow, so the Fregean Axiom fails.

*Source: Classicism, p. 61. General argument `arguments/nonidentity-arrow`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that Some arrow out of the evaluation object is not its identity. Here: The idempotent $k$. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*

### Holds □Relational Choice.

The truncation of a full action model at any arrow is again a full action model, its domains at the reachable objects being unchanged, and Relational Choice holds in every full model given choice in the metatheory (Classicism, p. 61).

*General argument `arguments/relational-choice-full-boxed`. It requires that The model is a full action model: an action model (Classicism, Appendix D) that is full at every object. Here: An action model, full at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59; Appendix D). By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 2026-09-22.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The two-object full action models' copies stated once for the topic, for every full action model.

### Holds Relational Choice.

With choice in the metatheory a serial relation has a functional subrelation, and a full model contains every intension, so that subrelation is in the domain; see Classicism, p. 61, on the principles common to full models.

*General argument `arguments/relational-choice-full`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-09-20.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The full action models' copies stated once for the topic.

### Holds Rigid Power, □Rigid Power.

Write $X_0(E)$ for the intension $k\mapsto k\cdot E$. The extension at an arrow $h$ of the power property $\lambda X\, .\,\operatorname{Rigid}(X)\land X\le F$ is the set of rigid $X$ with $X\le h\cdot F$, the bound variable ranging over the domain untransported and the parameter transported. By the condition the rigid relations are the $X_0(E)$, and $X_0(T)\le X_0(S)$ iff $T\subseteq S$; so for rigid $F=X_0(S)$ the power property has extension $\{X_0(T'):T'\subseteq k\cdot S\}$ at $k$, while transporting its extension at the identity along $k$ gives $\{X_0(k\cdot T):T\subseteq S\}$. These coincide, since every $T'\subseteq k\cdot S$ is $k\cdot T$ for $T:=\{s\in S:k\cdot s\in T'\}$. So the power property is itself $X_0$ of its extension, hence rigid, and the same at every reachable object gives the boxed form.

*General argument `arguments/rigid-power-tight`. It requires that At every object reachable from the evaluation point, the rigid relations of each relational type are exactly the intensions $k\mapsto k\cdot E$, the disjunctions of the haecceities of the members of $E$, for $E$ any set of tuples from the domains there; in particular every such intension is in the domain. Here: Every intension is present, so for any set $E$ the intension $k\mapsto k\cdot E$ is in the domain, and a relation is weakly inextensible at a world iff it lies below that intension over its extension there, since that is the smallest intension satisfying the hypothesis; with persistence, a rigid relation equals it (the argument deferred in extraction.md, 3 October 2026). By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), 3 October 2026 (full action models); extended by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 4 October 2026, at Cian Dorr's direction.*

*Revised 2026-10-04 by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The argument deferred in extraction.md on 3 October for the full action models, where every intension is present, stated under the condition it actually uses, which the symmetry-constrained full models also meet.

### Fails B for sentences of Σ.

B for sentences of Σ fails: the Σ-sentence $\forall\bar x\, .\,c\bar x$ denotes $a$, which is true, and under an arrow from which no world in $a$ is accessible $\Diamond a$ is false, so $\Box\Diamond a$ fails.

*General argument `arguments/sigma-true-atom-b`. It requires that Σ has a designated relational constant $c$ of type $\tau=\bar\sigma t$ denoting $\lambda\bar x\, .\,a$, where $a$ is the actual-world proposition, the unique true atom; every other constant, of which there is at least one, is relational and denotes the top element of its type. Here: This is the interpretation. It requires that The actual-world proposition $a$, the strongest truth, is in the domain; it is necessary at no world, and some arrow does not fix it. Here: The singleton $a$ of the identity arrow is in the domain, the model being full. It is necessary at no world: a world other than the identity sees itself, which lies outside $a$, and the identity sees an arrow other than itself. And a non-identity arrow $k$ does not fix it, since $1\in k\cdot a$ would need $1\circ k=1$. It requires that Some world sees no world at which the actual-world proposition is true. Here: The arrow $k$: $x\circ k=k$ for both arrows $x$, so no composite with it is the identity. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr’s request, 2026-09-22.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The B clause of the records' Σ-as-true-atom argument, stated once for the topic.

### Fails No Contingency (signature Σ), Witnessed Possibility, Separated Structure, Independence (signature Σ), Maximalism (signature Σ).

No Contingency (signature Σ) fails, since the Σ-sentence $\forall\bar x\, .\,c\bar x$ denotes $a$, true and contingent; Witnessed Possibility fails for the pure formula $x=\top_\tau$, witnessed by $\top_\tau$, since $\Diamond(c=\top_\tau)$ is $\Diamond\Box a$ and $a$ is necessary at no world; Separated Structure fails with it, being equivalent to Possibly Witnessed Possibility; Independence (signature Σ) and Distinctness Maximalism (signature Σ) fail through the other relational constants: such a constant $c'$ of type $\tau'$ denotes what the closed pure term $\top_{\tau'}$ denotes, and $c'=\top_{\tau'}$ is a true identity that C(Σ) does not prove. The designated constant refutes neither: closed pure terms denote entities fixed by every arrow (Classicism, §3.5, p. 58), whereas some arrow does not fix $a$, so no closed pure term denotes $\lambda\bar x\, .\,a$.

*General argument `arguments/sigma-true-atom`. It requires that Σ has a designated relational constant $c$ of type $\tau=\bar\sigma t$ denoting $\lambda\bar x\, .\,a$, where $a$ is the actual-world proposition, the unique true atom; every other constant, of which there is at least one, is relational and denotes the top element of its type. Here: This is the interpretation. It requires that The actual-world proposition $a$, the strongest truth, is in the domain; it is necessary at no world, and some arrow does not fix it. Here: The singleton $a$ of the identity arrow is in the domain, the model being full. It is necessary at no world: a world other than the identity sees itself, which lies outside $a$, and the identity sees an arrow other than itself. And a non-identity arrow $k$ does not fix it, since $1\in k\cdot a$ would need $1\circ k=1$. By Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr’s request, 2026-09-22.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The verbatim copies in ten records (finite-support, symmetric and full action models) stated once for the topic. Its B clause is now sigma-true-atom-b, which needs an arrow from which the actual world is out of reach. "$a$ is fixed by no arrow but the identity" became "some arrow does not fix $a$": in a symmetric model the actual-world proposition is the symmetry group, which its members fix, and the conclusion needs only the weaker claim.

### Holds Transversal Choice.

For an equivalence relation at the evaluation point, a transversal of its extension there, chosen in the metatheory, is by extensional fullness the extension of an element of the domain; the equivalence and transversal conditions are unboxed.

*General argument `arguments/transversal-choice-extensionally-full`. It requires that The model is extensionally full at every object: every set of tuples from the domains at an object is the extension, at the identity arrow, of an element of the domain of the matching relational type there. Here: A full model contains every intension, so in particular one with any given extension at the identity. By Cian Dorr (observation); recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), on a question of Zachary Goodsell, after an observation of Christopher Sun, 2026-09-25.*

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* The Relational Choice and Transversal Choice arguments merged into one, stated for every extensionally full model.

*Revised 2026-10-02 by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction:* Moved from the group finite-support-one-object to the topic. Its first sentence, deriving extensional fullness from ideal fullness, is now the group's reason for meeting extensionally-full.

### Fails ND (type t).

Let $k$ out of the evaluation object have no retraction. The propositions $\bot$ and $\{1\}$ are in the domain, the model being full, and $k$ transports both to $\bot$: no arrow $m$ after $k$ has $m\circ k=1$. So $k$'s action at type $t$ is not injective, and ND fails there (Proposition 3.24(i)).

*Source: Classicism, §3.5, Proposition 3.24(i). General argument `arguments/unretracted-arrow`. It requires that The model is full: at each object, the domain of each relational type contains every intension of that type. Here: Every intension of every relational type is present at every object (Classicism, §3.5, p. 59). It requires that Some arrow out of the evaluation object has no retraction. Here: $m\cdot k=k$ for both arrows $m$, so $k$ has no retraction. By Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction, 2026-10-06.*


## Notes

The cited construction is a model of the map’s relational-type framework. The description identifies its evaluation point; construction and verification are given at the PDF locations in References. Everything that implies these fails with them.

## History

The record's revision log before it was written as arguments.

- **2026-09-25** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added Transversal Choice, by the argument recorded for Relational Choice: a full model contains every intension, in particular one whose extension at the evaluation point is a transversal, chosen in the metatheory, of the extension there of an equivalence relation; the equivalence and transversal conditions are unboxed. Recorded on a question of Zachary Goodsell, after an observation of Christopher Sun. Now satisfies: Transversal Choice.
- **2026-09-25** (OpenAI Codex (GPT-6)) — Corrected the previously recorded necessary Strong Leibniz-t flag. Confirmed the trawl's Strong Leibniz-t failure: an admitted nonidentity-idempotent singleton shifts to a set containing both the identity and the idempotent, which a target-domain proposition separates. Quantifiers inside the box range over the entire target domain. The boxed failure follows by T. Now violates: Strong Leibniz Biconditionals (type t).
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Recorded the Distinctness-preserving collapse; see the notes. Now satisfies: Distinctness-preserving collapse.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Re-fixed the interpretation of Σ so as to settle No Contingency (signature Σ) and B for sentences of Σ, at Cian Dorr’s request; see the notes. Now violates: No Contingency (signature Σ), B for sentences of Σ.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Corrected the reason given for the failures of Independence (signature Σ) and Distinctness (signature Σ): the true atom is denoted by no closed pure term, since such terms denote entities fixed by every arrow; the failures come from the other relational constants, which denote top. No verdict changes.
- **2026-09-23** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Corrected the claim of 22 September 2026 that □Strong Leibniz Biconditionals (type t) hold: the argument that every singleton is a strong world needs the monoid to be right-cancellative, and here the transport of {k} along k is {1, k}. The type-t principle fails; see the notes. Now violates: Strong Leibniz Biconditionals (type t).
- **2026-09-22** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Fixed an interpretation of Σ (relational constants as top, individual constants as one fixed individual) and recorded the signature schemata it refutes, at Cian Dorr’s request. Now violates: Witnessed Possibility, Separated Structure, Independence (signature Σ), Maximalism (signature Σ).
- **2026-09-22** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added □Strong Leibniz Biconditionals (type t): every singleton of an arrow is a strong world in a propositionally full one-object model; see the notes. Superseded on 25 September 2026: the transported-image quantifier argument was false; the removed positive flag is preserved here as history, not a current verdict. Withdrawn on 23 September 2026: the claim was mistaken; see the later entry.
- **2026-09-22** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Boxed the Relational Choice claim; see the notes. Now satisfies: □Relational Choice.
- **2026-09-20** (Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic)) — Added Relational Choice at Cian Dorr's direction. With choice in the metatheory a serial relation has a functional subrelation, and a full model contains every intension, so that subrelation is in the domain; see Classicism, p. 61, on the principles common to full models. The propositions at the evaluation object are the subsets of the two arrows out of it, four in all, and every intension of a full model is present, so the numerals are the finite cardinalities and the fourth holds of the universal property of propositions: the Axiom of Infinity at type t fails, as does the fifth instance of the schema. Now satisfies: Relational Choice. Now violates: Axiom of Infinity (type t), Infinity Schema (type t).
- **2026-09-17** (OpenAI Codex (GPT-6)) — Adopted the source’s relational type system at the user’s request. The cited construction now directly supplies the recorded model; the former type-extension obligation is removed. Now satisfies: □Rigid Comprehension, □Atomicity, □Actuality, No Pure Contingency. Now violates: ND (type t), BF (type t), Fregean Axiom.
