# Actuality ⇒ Vicinity

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Misc., Lean `Classicism.Map.actuality_implies_vicinity`; produced by Cian Dorr, 27 September 2026 (noted as obvious when Vicinity was introduced); recorded by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), 27 September 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **Actuality.** There is a true proposition that entails every true proposition.

## Conclusion

- **Vicinity.** There is a true proposition that entails the possibility of each true proposition.

## Proof

Let $w$ witness Actuality and let $q$ be true. Then $w\le q$, i.e. $\Box(w\to q)$. By T, $q\to\Diamond q$ is a theorem of C, so by necessitation $\Box(q\to\Diamond q)$, and K gives $\Box(w\to\Diamond q)$, i.e. $w\le\Diamond q$. So $w$ witnesses Vicinity.

## Notes

The implication Actuality → Vicinity is a theorem of C, which is what the boxed version uses.
