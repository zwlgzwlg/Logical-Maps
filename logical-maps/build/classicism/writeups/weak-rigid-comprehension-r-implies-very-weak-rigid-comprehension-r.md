# Weak Rigid Comprehension ⇒ Very Weak Rigid Comprehension

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Misc., Lean `Classicism.Map.weak_rigid_comprehension_r_implies_very_weak_rigid_comprehension_r`; produced by Cian Dorr, suggestion of 19 September 2026; recorded by Claude Opus 5 (Anthropic), 19 September 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **Weak Rigid Comprehension.** Every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a weakly rigid one, that is, with one that is persistent and weakly inextensible.

## Conclusion

- **Very Weak Rigid Comprehension.** Every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a very weakly rigid one, that is, with one that is weakly persistent and weakly inextensible.

## Proof

$\operatorname{Persistent}(Y)$ is $Y\le\lambda\bar x\, .\,\Box Y[\bar x]$, which unpacks as $\Box\forall\bar x\, .\,Y[\bar x]\to\Box Y[\bar x]$; T gives $\operatorname{WeaklyPersistent}(Y)$. The inextensibility conjunct is the same in both conditions. So every weakly rigid relation is very weakly rigid, and a weakly rigid coextension is already a very weakly rigid one.
