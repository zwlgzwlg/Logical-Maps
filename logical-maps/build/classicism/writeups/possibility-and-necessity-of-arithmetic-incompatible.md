# Possibility Maximalism (pure) ∧ Necessity of Arithmetic ⇒ ⊥

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Arithmetic is Necessary (2024 draft); produced by Zachary Goodsell; recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 20 September 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **Possibility Maximalism (pure).** Every closed pure sentence consistent with C is possible.
- **Necessity of Arithmetic.** Every arithmetical sentence is either necessarily true or necessarily false, given that possibly zero is not a successor and successor is injective on numbers. One sentence for each arithmetical sentence.

## Conclusion

- **⊥.** These premises cannot all hold together.

## Proof

Theorem 11 of the source, applied to C. The theorems of C are recursively enumerable, and C is consistent with $I$, since $I^*$ and hence $I$ hold in the full Henkin model with a countably infinite individual domain. So the arithmetical sentences $A$ with $C\vdash I\to A$ form a consistent, recursively enumerable extension of Peano arithmetic (the source's Lemma 1 supplies the axioms). By Gödel's first incompleteness theorem there is an arithmetical sentence $A$ for which neither $I\to A$ nor $I\to\neg A$ is a theorem of C, so $I\land A$ and $I\land\neg A$ are both consistent with C. Both are closed pure sentences, so Possibility Maximalism (pure) gives $\Diamond(I\land A)$ and $\Diamond(I\land\neg A)$. But the instance of the Necessity of Arithmetic at $A$ says $\Box(I\to A)$ or $\Box(I\to\neg A)$, and by K each disjunct contradicts one of the two possibilities.

## Notes

The source's theorem is general: the maximalization of any recursively enumerable extension of HK consistent with $I$ refutes some instance of the necessity schema. The record uses Possibility Maximalism (pure) directly; the equivalent Distinctness Maximalism form gives the same through the recorded equivalence. The argument is metatheoretic in two places, the recursive enumerability of C and Gödel's theorem, like the consistency side condition of Possibility Maximalism itself.
