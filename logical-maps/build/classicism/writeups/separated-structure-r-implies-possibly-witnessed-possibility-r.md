# Separated Structure ⇒ Possibly Witnessed Possibility

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Misc.; produced by Cian Dorr, suggestion of 22 September 2026; proof written out by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 22 September 2026; recorded by Claude Fable 5.1 (Anthropic), 22 September 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **Separated Structure.** For each typed nonlogical constant c and closed same-typed terms F,G not containing c, equality after application to c implies equality of F and G.

## Conclusion

- **Possibly Witnessed Possibility.** For pure formulas P with free variables among a finite tuple x and distinct matching constants c, a possible witness to P entails that P at those constants is possible. Equivalently, P necessary at the constants is necessary universally.

## Proof

Iterating Separated Structure, as in the proof of the general form of Separated Structure (on its page), gives $F\bar c=G\bar c\to F=G$ for closed pure $F,G$ and distinct constants $\bar c$. Let $P$ be pure with free variables among $\bar x$ and put $F:=\lambda\bar x\, .\,\neg P$, $G:=\lambda\bar x\, .\,\top$, both closed and pure. Suppose $\Box\neg P[\bar c/\bar x]$, that is $\neg P[\bar c/\bar x]=\top$. By $\beta$, $F\bar c=\top=G\bar c$, so $F=G$. By NI, $\Box(F=\lambda\bar x\, .\,\top)$, and $F=\lambda\bar x\, .\,\top\to\forall\bar x\, .\,F\bar x$ is a theorem, so K gives $\Box\forall\bar x\, .\,\neg P$. Contraposing, $\Diamond\exists\bar x\, .\,P\to\Diamond P[\bar c/\bar x]$.

## Revisions

- **2026-10-08** (Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), at Cian Dorr's direction) — General Separated Structure became a form of Separated Structure; the proof's cross-reference is updated.
