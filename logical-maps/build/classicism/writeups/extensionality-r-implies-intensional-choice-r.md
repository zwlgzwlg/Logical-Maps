# Extensionality ⇒ Intensional Choice

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Misc.; produced by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), 3 October 2026, from a suggestion of Cian Dorr; recorded by Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic), 3 October 2026.</p>

## Premises

- **Extensionality.** At each relational type, coextensive relations are identical; include the nullary propositional case.

## Conclusion

- **Intensional Choice.** If a property is necessarily instantiated, then some property entailing it is necessarily uniquely instantiated.

## Proof

Extensionality at type $t$ identifies every truth with $\top$, so $p\to\Box p$ for every proposition $p$. Let $F$ be necessarily instantiated. By T it is instantiated, say by $a$, and then $\Box Fa$. Put $G:=\lambda x\, .\,x=a$. Then $\Box\forall x\, .\,Gx\to Fx$, that is $G\le F$, and $\exists x\, .\,(Gx\land\forall y\, .\,Gy\to y=x)$ is a theorem, hence necessary.

## Notes

The witness is the haecceity of any instance.
