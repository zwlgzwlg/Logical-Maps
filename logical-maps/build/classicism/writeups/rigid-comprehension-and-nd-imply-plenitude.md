## Premises

- **Rigid Comprehension.** Every relation, including a proposition, is coextensive with a rigid one.
- **ND.** Distinct things of any type are necessarily distinct.

## Conclusion

- **Plenitude.** Every total single-valued binary relation is represented by an operation. Its output type is relational, as required by the type system.

## Proof

For functional U with propositional output, choose a rigid coextension $U^*$ and put $Zy=\forall p\, .\,(U^*y)p\to p$. If Uxq, persistence makes $(U^*x)q$ necessary, so Zx entails q. Functionality, NI and ND make every $U^*$-pair necessarily either have a different first coordinate or have second coordinate q. Inextensibility combines this into necessary uniqueness at x, which gives q entails Zx. Thus Zx=q and Z represents U. The source extends this construction pointwise to every relational relational output type.
