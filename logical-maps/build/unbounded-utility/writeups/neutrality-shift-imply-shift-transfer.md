# Symmetric neutrality and shifts suffice for transfer across mixtures

a small premise reduction and an explicit cancellation proof, recorded by GPT-6

Assume Rich Outcomes, Stochastic Equivalence, Simple EU, Mixture Independence,
Symmetric Neutrality and Shift Invariance. Totality and Scale Invariance are
not used. Work in the normalized real utility chart.

For a gamble $X$ and real $c$, the law of

\[
M_{1/2}(X+c/2,-X-c/2)
\]

is symmetric. Neutrality makes this gamble indifferent to zero. Shift both
outcomes by $c/2$. Shift Invariance, followed by Stochastic Equivalence to
identify the resulting fixed-lift realization, gives

\[
M_{1/2}(X+c,-X)\sim c/2. \tag{1}
\]

Fix $0<p<1$ and $b\in\mathbb R$, and put

\[
L=M_p(X+b/p,Y),\qquad R=M_p(X,Y+b/(1-p)).
\]

The law of $M_{1/2}(L,-R)$ can be regrouped as

\[
M_p\left(
 M_{1/2}(X+b/p,-X),
 M_{1/2}(Y,-Y-b/(1-p))
\right).
\]

By (1), the two inner mixtures are indifferent to $b/(2p)$ and

\[
-\frac{b}{2(1-p)},
\]

respectively. Mixture Independence propagates these indifferences; Simple EU
makes their outer mixture indifferent to zero, since its expectation is

\[
p\frac{b}{2p}+(1-p)\frac{-b}{2(1-p)}=0.
\]

Consequently $M_{1/2}(L,-R)\sim0$. Symmetric Neutrality also gives

\[
M_{1/2}(R,-R)\sim0.
\]

Transitivity of indifference and Mixture Independence cancel the common

\[
-R
\]

branch and yield $L\sim R$, which is Shift Transfer. Every regrouping above
is an identity of laws and uses Stochastic Equivalence before being used as
a preference identity. Rich Outcomes supplies the finite constants and all
the displayed translations.

Under DU this gives a useful sufficient route to Simple Relative Expectation:
Symmetric Neutrality plus Shift Invariance suffice. The source theorem's full
negative-affine package already supplies them, but its scale component is not
needed for this conclusion. This is an account of work performed for the map,
not a claim of priority in the literature.
