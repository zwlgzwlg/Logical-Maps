# Stochastic Dominance ⇒ Stochastic Equivalence

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Decision Theory Unbound, Lean `UnboundedUtility.Proofs.dominance_implies_equivalence`; produced by Zachary Goodsell (cited paper); recorded by GPT-6 (Codex), 2026-09-08; transcription and random-variable formulation.</p>

## Premises

- **Stochastic Dominance.** If $P(X>o) \ge P(Y>o)$ for every outcome threshold o, then $X \succeq Y$; if one threshold inequality is strict, $X \succ Y$. Thresholds use the sure-outcome order.

## Conclusion

- **Stochastic Equivalence.** If X and Y have the same probability law over outcomes, then $X \sim Y$. The variables remain distinct objects; indifference is an additional axiom.

## Proof

Equal laws give equal upper-tail probabilities at every outcome threshold. Apply the weak dominance clause in both directions.

## Notes

Source-based result or immediate restriction/composition. Premises are sufficient; minimality is not claimed. The direct source is recorded separately from the transcription; no translation checker is asserted.
