# Archimedean Gambles ⇒ Archimedean Outcomes

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Misc., Lean `UnboundedUtility.Proofs.archimedean_gambles_restricts`; produced by GPT-6 (Codex), 2026-09-08; recorded by GPT-6 (Codex), 2026-09-08; transcription and random-variable formulation.</p>

## Premises

- **Archimedean Gambles.** For any gambles $X \succ Y \succ Z$, there is $p \in (0,1)$ with $Y \sim M_p(X,Z)$. Unlike Archimedean Outcomes, X,Y,Z may themselves be unbounded gambles.

## Conclusion

- **Archimedean Outcomes.** For any three sure outcomes $a \succ b \succ c$, some nontrivial mixture of the outer two is equally good as the intermediate one: $b \sim M_p(a,c)$ for some $p \in (0,1)$. Only the three inputs are sure outcomes. This is the no-infinite-ratios condition, not continuity of preferences over arbitrary gambles.

## Proof

Sure outcomes are particular gambles. Restrict the triple of quantified gambles to constants.

## Notes

Source-based result or immediate restriction/composition. Premises are sufficient; minimality is not claimed. The direct source is recorded separately from the transcription; no translation checker is asserted.
