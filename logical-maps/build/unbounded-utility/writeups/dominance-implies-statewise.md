# Archimedean Outcomes ∧ Stochastic Dominance ⇒ Statewise Dominance

## Premises

- **Archimedean Outcomes.** For any three sure outcomes $a \succ b \succ c$, some nontrivial mixture of the outer two is equally good as the intermediate one: $b \sim M_p(a,c)$ for some $p \in (0,1)$. Only the three inputs are sure outcomes. This is the no-infinite-ratios condition, not continuity of preferences over arbitrary gambles.
- **Stochastic Dominance.** If $P(X>o) \ge P(Y>o)$ for every outcome threshold o, then $X \succeq Y$; if one threshold inequality is strict, $X \succ Y$. Thresholds use the sure-outcome order.

## Conclusion

- **Statewise Dominance.** If $X \ge Y$ almost surely in the sure-outcome order, then $X \succeq Y$; if also $P(X>Y)>0$, then $X \succ Y$.

## Proof

Use the real outcome chart supplied by Archimedean Outcomes. If $X\ge Y$ almost surely, $\{Y>t\}\subseteq \{X>t\}$ modulo null events. If $P(X>Y)>0$, the countable family of rational cuts contains a cut with $P(Y\le t<X)>0$; approximate by a realized outcome threshold if necessary. The strict tail inequality then gives strict preference.

## Notes

Source-based result or immediate restriction/composition. Premises are sufficient; minimality is not claimed. The direct source is recorded separately from the transcription; no translation checker is asserted.
