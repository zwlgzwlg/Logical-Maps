# Stochastic Equivalence ∧ Mixture Independence ⇒ Sure-Thing

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Decision Theory Unbound; produced by Zachary Goodsell (cited paper); recorded by GPT-6 (Codex), 2026-09-08; transcription and random-variable formulation.</p>

## Premises

- **Stochastic Equivalence.** If X and Y have the same probability law over outcomes, then $X \sim Y$. The variables remain distinct objects; indifference is an additional axiom.
- **Mixture Independence.** For all X,Y,Z and $0<p<1, X \succeq Y$ iff $M_p(X,Z) \succeq M_p(Y,Z)$, where M is the fixed randomized-selection construction described in the background.

## Conclusion

- **Sure-Thing.** For an event E with $0<P(E)<1$, if $X|E \sim Y|E$, then $X \succeq Y$ iff $X|E^{c} \succeq Y|E^{c}$. Here X|E equals X on E and sure 0 elsewhere; it is not a conditional expectation.

## Proof

Let $p=P(E)$. Realize the conditional laws on E and $E^{c}$ as A,B for X and C,D for Y. Law invariance gives $X\sim M_p(A,B), Y\sim M_p(C,D), X|E\sim M_p(A,0), Y|E\sim M_p(C,0)$. Independence cancels 0 to yield $A\sim C$ from the hypothesis. Replace indifferent mixture components and cancel the common E component: $X\succeq Y$ iff $B\succeq D$. The latter is equivalent to $X|E^{c}\succeq Y|E^{c}$ by independence and law invariance.

## Notes

Source-based result or immediate restriction/composition. Premises are sufficient; minimality is not claimed. The direct source is recorded separately from the transcription; no translation checker is asserted.
