# Expected Utility ⇒ Simple Expected Utility

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Misc., Lean `UnboundedUtility.Proofs.expected_utility_implies_simple`; produced by GPT-6 (Codex), 2026-09-08; recorded by GPT-6 (Codex), 2026-09-08; transcription and random-variable formulation.</p>

## Premises

- **Expected Utility.** The normalized chart u is defined on all outcomes and is measurable. Whenever $u(X),u(Y)$ are integrable, $X \succeq Y$ iff $E[u(X)] \ge E[u(Y)]$. Expectations here are finite Lebesgue expectations; this says nothing about two $+\infty$ expectations or conditionally convergent sums.

## Conclusion

- **Simple Expected Utility.** The normalized real utility chart u is defined on every outcome, is measurable, and ranks every pair of simple random variables exactly by finite expected utility: $X \succeq Y$ iff $E[u(X)] \ge E[u(Y)]$. Surjectivity of u is not included here.

## Proof

All simple variables have finite real expected utility. Restrict Expected Utility to them.

## Notes

Source-based result or immediate restriction/composition. Premises are sufficient; minimality is not claimed. The direct source is recorded separately from the transcription; no translation checker is asserted.
