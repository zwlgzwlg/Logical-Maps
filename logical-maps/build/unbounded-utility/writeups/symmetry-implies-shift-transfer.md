## Premises

- **Rich Outcomes.** Every real number r occurs as a utility level of a sure outcome: for each $r \in \mathbb{R}$ there is an outcome $o_r$ with $u(o_r)=r$, with u defined by the normalized binary-mixture comparisons in the background. This does not assert that every outcome has a finite real level.
- **Totality.** For all gambles X,Y, either $X \succeq Y$ or $Y \succeq X$.
- **Stochastic Equivalence.** If X and Y have the same probability law over outcomes, then $X \sim Y$. The variables remain distinct objects; indifference is an additional axiom.
- **Simple Expected Utility.** The normalized real utility chart u is defined on every outcome, is measurable, and ranks every pair of simple random variables exactly by finite expected utility: $X \succeq Y$ iff $E[u(X)] \ge E[u(Y)]$. Surjectivity of u is not included here.
- **Stochastic Dominance.** If $P(X>o) \ge P(Y>o)$ for every outcome threshold o, then $X \succeq Y$; if one threshold inequality is strict, $X \succ Y$. Thresholds use the sure-outcome order.
- **Mixture Independence.** For all X,Y,Z and $0<p<1, X \succeq Y$ iff $M_p(X,Z) \succeq M_p(Y,Z)$, where M is the fixed randomized-selection construction described in the background.
- **Negative Affine Anti-Invariance.** For all real $a>0$ and $b, X \succeq Y$ iff $- aY+b \succeq - aX+b$.

## Conclusion

- **Transfer of a Shift Across a Mixture.** For all real $b$ and $0<p<1$, $M_p(X+\frac{b}{p},Y)\sim M_p(X,Y+\frac{b}{1-p})$. Variables and transformed outcomes are in the real utility chart.

## Proof

This is Theorem 3 transported from laws to random variables using Stochastic Equivalence. Reflection, Totality and Independence first make a half-mixture of V and −V indifferent to 0. Shift invariance then gives $M_{1/2}(V+c,- V)\sim c/2$. Pair the terms on the two sides of the proposed transfer with their negatives; both reduce to the same simple constant mixture. Independence cancels the common terms.

## Notes

Source-based result or immediate restriction/composition. Premises are sufficient; minimality is not claimed. The direct source is recorded separately from the transcription; no translation checker is asserted.
