# Rich Outcomes ∧ Folded Expectation ⇒ Symmetric Gambles Are Neutral

## Premises

- **Rich Outcomes.** Every real number r occurs as a utility level of a sure outcome: for each $r \in \mathbb{R}$ there is an outcome $o_r$ with $u(o_r)=r$, with u defined by the normalized binary-mixture comparisons in the background. This does not assert that every outcome has a finite real level.
- **Folded Expectation.** Put $h_X(t)=P(u(X)>t)- P(u(X)<- t)$ for $t\ge 0$. If $\int _0^{\infty }|h_X(t)|dt$ and $\int _0^{\infty }|h_Y(t)|dt$ are finite, compare X,Y exactly by $F(X)=\int _0^{\infty }h_X(t)dt$ and $F(Y)$. Boundary atoms do not change these integrals.

## Conclusion

- **Symmetric Gambles Are Neutral.** If $u(X)$ and $- u(X)$ have the same law, then $X \sim 0$.

## Proof

For a symmetric real $\operatorname{law}, h_X(t)=0$ almost everywhere, so $F(X)=0$. The zero constant also has folded value zero; apply Folded Expectation.

## Notes

Source-based result or immediate restriction/composition. Premises are sufficient; minimality is not claimed. The direct source is recorded separately from the transcription; no translation checker is asserted.
