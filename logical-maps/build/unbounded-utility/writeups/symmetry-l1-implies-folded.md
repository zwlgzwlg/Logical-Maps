## Premises

- **Rich Outcomes.** Every real number r occurs as a utility level of a sure outcome: for each $r \in \mathbb{R}$ there is an outcome $o_r$ with $u(o_r)=r$, with u defined by the normalized binary-mixture comparisons in the background. This does not assert that every outcome has a finite real level.
- **Totality.** For all gambles X,Y, either $X \succeq Y$ or $Y \succeq X$.
- **Stochastic Equivalence.** If X and Y have the same probability law over outcomes, then $X \sim Y$. The variables remain distinct objects; indifference is an additional axiom.
- **Simple Expected Utility.** The normalized real utility chart u is defined on every outcome, is measurable, and ranks every pair of simple random variables exactly by finite expected utility: $X \succeq Y$ iff $E[u(X)] \ge E[u(Y)]$. Surjectivity of u is not included here.
- **Stochastic Dominance.** If $P(X>o) \ge P(Y>o)$ for every outcome threshold o, then $X \succeq Y$; if one threshold inequality is strict, $X \succ Y$. Thresholds use the sure-outcome order.
- **Mixture Independence.** For all X,Y,Z and $0<p<1, X \succeq Y$ iff $M_p(X,Z) \succeq M_p(Y,Z)$, where M is the fixed randomized-selection construction described in the background.
- **Negative Affine Anti-Invariance.** For all real $a>0$ and $b, X \succeq Y$ iff $- aY+b \succeq - aX+b$.
- **L¹ Continuity (random variables).** On variables with real utility levels, if $E|u(X_n)- u(X)| \to 0$ and $X_n \succeq Y$ for every n, then $X \succeq Y$. Only the upper-section clause is imposed, matching the paper. Distance can be infinite between other pairs.

## Conclusion

- **Folded Expectation.** Put $h_X(t)=P(u(X)>t)- P(u(X)<- t)$ for $t\ge 0$. If $\int _0^{\infty }|h_X(t)|dt$ and $\int _0^{\infty }|h_Y(t)|dt$ are finite, compare X,Y exactly by $F(X)=\int _0^{\infty }h_X(t)dt$ and $F(Y)$. Boundary atoms do not change these integrals.

## Proof

Theorem 6 couples the positive and negative utility tails in opposing order. Absolute integrability of the folded tail difference yields an integrable difference of these tail variables, with expectation $F(X)$. Relative Expectation (Corollary 5) and reflection identify X with sure $F(X)$. Apply the same construction to Y and compare the constants. Law invariance transfers the chosen couplings to the original variables.

## Notes

Source-based result or immediate restriction/composition. Premises are sufficient; minimality is not claimed. The direct source is recorded separately from the transcription; no translation checker is asserted.
