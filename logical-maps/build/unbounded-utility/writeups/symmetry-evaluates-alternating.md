## Premises

- **Rich Outcomes.** Every real number r occurs as a utility level of a sure outcome: for each $r \in \mathbb{R}$ there is an outcome $o_r$ with $u(o_r)=r$, with u defined by the normalized binary-mixture comparisons in the background. This does not assert that every outcome has a finite real level.
- **Totality.** For all gambles X,Y, either $X \succeq Y$ or $Y \succeq X$.
- **Stochastic Equivalence.** If X and Y have the same probability law over outcomes, then $X \sim Y$. The variables remain distinct objects; indifference is an additional axiom.
- **Simple Expected Utility.** The normalized real utility chart u is defined on every outcome, is measurable, and ranks every pair of simple random variables exactly by finite expected utility: $X \succeq Y$ iff $E[u(X)] \ge E[u(Y)]$. Surjectivity of u is not included here.
- **Stochastic Dominance.** If $P(X>o) \ge P(Y>o)$ for every outcome threshold o, then $X \succeq Y$; if one threshold inequality is strict, $X \succ Y$. Thresholds use the sure-outcome order.
- **Mixture Independence.** For all X,Y,Z and $0<p<1, X \succeq Y$ iff $M_p(X,Z) \succeq M_p(Y,Z)$, where M is the fixed randomized-selection construction described in the background.
- **Negative Affine Anti-Invariance.** For all real $a>0$ and $b, X \succeq Y$ iff $- aY+b \succeq - aX+b$.

## Conclusion

- **Alternating St Petersburg = −1/2.** Every $X$ with
$$P(u(X)=(-2)^n)=2^{-n},\qquad n\ge 1$$
is indifferent to sure utility $-\frac{1}{2}$.

## Proof

The law identity $A =d M_{1/2}(- 2,- 2A)$ gives indifference by Stochastic Equivalence. If $A\succ - 1/2$ then $- 2A\prec 1$, so Independence and Simple EU imply $A\sim M_{1/2}(- 2,- 2A)\prec M_{1/2}(- 2,1)\sim - 1/2$, contradiction. The opposite strict case is analogous. Totality gives $A\sim - 1/2$.

## Notes

Source-based result or immediate restriction/composition. Premises are sufficient; minimality is not claimed. The direct source is recorded separately from the transcription; no translation checker is asserted.
