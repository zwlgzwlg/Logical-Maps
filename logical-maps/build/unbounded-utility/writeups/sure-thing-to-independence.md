## Premises

- **Rich Outcomes.** Every real number r occurs as a utility level of a sure outcome: for each $r \in \mathbb{R}$ there is an outcome $o_r$ with $u(o_r)=r$, with u defined by the normalized binary-mixture comparisons in the background. This does not assert that every outcome has a finite real level.
- **Archimedean Outcomes.** For any three sure outcomes $a \succ b \succ c$, some nontrivial mixture of the outer two is equally good as the intermediate one: $b \sim M_p(a,c)$ for some $p \in (0,1)$. Only the three inputs are sure outcomes. This is the no-infinite-ratios condition, not continuity of preferences over arbitrary gambles.
- **Totality.** For all gambles X,Y, either $X \succeq Y$ or $Y \succeq X$.
- **Stochastic Dominance.** If $P(X>o) \ge P(Y>o)$ for every outcome threshold o, then $X \succeq Y$; if one threshold inequality is strict, $X \succ Y$. Thresholds use the sure-outcome order.
- **Sure-Thing.** For an event E with $0<P(E)<1$, if $X|E \sim Y|E$, then $X \succeq Y$ iff $X|E^{c} \succeq Y|E^{c}$. Here X|E equals X on E and sure 0 elsewhere; it is not a conditional expectation.

## Conclusion

- **Mixture Independence.** For all X,Y,Z and $0<p<1, X \succeq Y$ iff $M_p(X,Z) \succeq M_p(Y,Z)$, where M is the fixed randomized-selection construction described in the background.

## Proof

Source reduction, §3.2: in the original DTU framework, Stochastic Dominance yields Stochastic Equivalence. Preferences therefore descend to laws. Every law and its conditional realizations are available by Prospect Richness, and the paper identifies Sure-Thing in this quotient with von Neumann–Morgenstern Independence. Pull this implication back along X↦$L(X)$. The full original DTU assumptions are retained; a weaker converse for arbitrary incomplete orders has not been extracted.

## Notes

Source-based result or immediate restriction/composition. Premises are sufficient; minimality is not claimed. The direct source is recorded separately from the transcription; no translation checker is asserted.
