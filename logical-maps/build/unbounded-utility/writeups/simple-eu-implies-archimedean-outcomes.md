# Simple Expected Utility ⇒ Archimedean Outcomes

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Symmetries of Value; produced by Zachary Goodsell (cited paper); recorded by GPT-6 (Codex), 2026-09-08; transcription and random-variable formulation.</p>

## Premises

- **Simple Expected Utility.** The normalized real utility chart u is defined on every outcome, is measurable, and ranks every pair of simple random variables exactly by finite expected utility: $X \succeq Y$ iff $E[u(X)] \ge E[u(Y)]$. Surjectivity of u is not included here.

## Conclusion

- **Archimedean Outcomes.** For any three sure outcomes $a \succ b \succ c$, some nontrivial mixture of the outer two is equally good as the intermediate one: $b \sim M_p(a,c)$ for some $p \in (0,1)$. Only the three inputs are sure outcomes. This is the no-infinite-ratios condition, not continuity of preferences over arbitrary gambles.

## Proof

For $a\succ b\succ c$ put $p=(u(b)- u(c))/(u(a)- u(c))$. Then $0<p<1$ and the simple variable $M_p(a,c)$ has expectation $u(b)$, so is indifferent to b.

## Notes

Source-based result or immediate restriction/composition. Premises are sufficient; minimality is not claimed. The direct source is recorded separately from the transcription; no translation checker is asserted.
