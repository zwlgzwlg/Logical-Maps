## Premises

- **Rich Outcomes.** Every real number r occurs as a utility level of a sure outcome: for each $r \in \mathbb{R}$ there is an outcome $o_r$ with $u(o_r)=r$, with u defined by the normalized binary-mixture comparisons in the background. This does not assert that every outcome has a finite real level.
- **Archimedean Outcomes.** For any three sure outcomes $a \succ b \succ c$, some nontrivial mixture of the outer two is equally good as the intermediate one: $b \sim M_p(a,c)$ for some $p \in (0,1)$. Only the three inputs are sure outcomes. This is the no-infinite-ratios condition, not continuity of preferences over arbitrary gambles.
- **Totality.** For all gambles X,Y, either $X \succeq Y$ or $Y \succeq X$.
- **Stochastic Dominance.** If $P(X>o) \ge P(Y>o)$ for every outcome threshold o, then $X \succeq Y$; if one threshold inequality is strict, $X \succ Y$. Thresholds use the sure-outcome order.
- **Sure-Thing.** For an event E with $0<P(E)<1$, if $X|E \sim Y|E$, then $X \succeq Y$ iff $X|E^{c} \succeq Y|E^{c}$. Here X|E equals X on E and sure 0 elsewhere; it is not a conditional expectation.

## Conclusion

- **Simple Expected Utility.** The normalized real utility chart u is defined on every outcome, is measurable, and ranks every pair of simple random variables exactly by finite expected utility: $X \succeq Y$ iff $E[u(X)] \ge E[u(Y)]$. Surjectivity of u is not included here.

## Proof

Goodsell §3.2 gives the finite-lottery representation consequence of the original DTU axioms. Stochastic Dominance includes law invariance; Sure-Thing becomes Independence on laws. Restrict to finite gambles and use the outcome mixture calibrations to obtain the normalized vNM utility representation. Prospect Richness, Preordering and comparable outcomes are standing here.

## Notes

Source-based result or immediate restriction/composition. Premises are sufficient; minimality is not claimed. The direct source is recorded separately from the transcription; no translation checker is asserted.
