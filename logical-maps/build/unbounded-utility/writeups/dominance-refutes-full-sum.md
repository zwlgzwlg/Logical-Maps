# Rich Outcomes ∧ Stochastic Dominance ∧ Full Sum Invariance ⇒ ⊥

<p class='cert'>Result — Source: Preference for Equivalent RVs; produced by Teddy Seidenfeld, Mark J. Schervish and Joseph B. Kadane (impossibility result); Zachary Goodsell (sum-invariance presentation); recorded by GPT-6 (Codex), 2026-09-09; extraction and random-variable translation.</p>

## Premises

- **Rich Outcomes.** Every real number r occurs as a utility level of a sure outcome: for each $r \in \mathbb{R}$ there is an outcome $o_r$ with $u(o_r)=r$, with u defined by the normalized binary-mixture comparisons in the background. This does not assert that every outcome has a finite real level.
- **Stochastic Dominance.** If $P(X>o) \ge P(Y>o)$ for every outcome threshold o, then $X \succeq Y$; if one threshold inequality is strict, $X \succ Y$. Thresholds use the sure-outcome order.
- **Full Sum Invariance.** For all X,Y,Z, with arbitrary dependence, $X \succeq Y$ iff $X+Z \succeq Y+Z$.

## Conclusion

- **⊥.** These premises cannot all hold together.

## Proof

Let P,Q each have St Petersburg $\operatorname{law} P(P=2^{n})=2^{-n}, n\ge 1$, coupled antitonically so exactly one equals 2. Dominance supplies Stochastic Equivalence, hence $P\sim Q$. Full Sum Invariance with common summand P would give $2P\sim P+Q$. But $P+Q$ has the law of $2P+2$: for $n\ge 2$ it takes $2^{n}+2$ with probability $2^{1- n}$. This strictly stochastically dominates the law of 2P, contradicting the asserted indifference. Rich Outcomes and standing prospect richness supply the variables and sums.

## Notes

The impossibility is due to Seidenfeld, Schervish and Kadane. In their Example 3.1, X1, X2 and W have the St Petersburg law and $X1+X2=2W+2$. The recorded proof uses this construction in common-addend form. Goodsell’s manuscript is a later presentation, not the origin of the result. The premises, proof and verification status are unchanged.
