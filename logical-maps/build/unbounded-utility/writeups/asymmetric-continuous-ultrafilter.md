# Clipped expectation: continuous ultrafilter dominance [−t, 2t]

**Direct source: Symmetries of Value.** Zachary Goodsell’s *Symmetries of
value*, Theorem 1 (p. 24), already states that DTU does not imply the affine
symmetry principles, including when $L^{1}$ Continuity and Relative Expectation
are added. Its reflection countermodel explicitly invokes *Decision theory
unbound*, Remark 3. Thus both the asymmetric construction and this stronger
non-implication belong to Goodsell; they are not new AI results.

The underlying continuous quotient appears in *Decision theory unbound*,
Appendix B, Definition 3, Lemma 6 and proof of Theorem 3 (pp. 691–692).
Remark 3 and Corollary 3 (pp. 692–693) supply separate increasing unbounded
cutoffs and symmetric gambles with arbitrary real values, including nonzero
ones.

**Original work: source-model specialization and additional verification.**
GPT-6 (Codex), 9 September 2026, chose the explicit cutoffs $f(t)=2t, g(t)=t$
and recorded the detailed proofs below. The added work is the displayed
CDF-area and shift-transfer verification, exact Cauchy and alternating-game
values, and negative-self-similarity witness. The $L^{1}/$Relative Expectation
non-implication is already stated in the source; its proof here is an explicit
verification, not a newly discovered separation. No literature-novelty claim,
independent checker or Lean verification is asserted.

## Construction and the DTU axioms

Take $O=\mathbb R$ with its usual order, Borel structure and identity utility,
and all measurable real random variables on the topic's fixed probability
space. Put

$$q_t(x)=\max(-t,\min(x,2t)),\qquad
v_X(t)=E[q_t(X)],\qquad t>0.$$

Fix an ultrafilter $\mathcal U$ on $(0,\infty)$ containing every tail
$(s,\infty)$. Define

$$X\succeq Y\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
\forall\varepsilon>0,\quad
\{t:v_X(t)-v_Y(t)\ge-\varepsilon\}\in\mathcal U.\tag{1}$$

Existence of this ultrafilter uses the usual ultrafilter lemma, as in the
source construction; this is a mathematical existence model, not an
implemented algorithm for arbitrary comparisons.

Reflexivity is immediate. For transitivity, intersect the two large sets
obtained with $\varepsilon/2$. If $X\not\succeq Y$, there is an
$\varepsilon>0$ such that $v_Y-v_X>\varepsilon$ on a large set.
Consequently $Y\succeq X$, proving **Totality**.

Equal laws have equal $v$-functions, so **Stochastic Equivalence** holds.
Constants and all values of each simple gamble eventually lie inside the
clipping window. Their comparisons are therefore exactly their ordinary
expectation comparisons. The normalized chart is the identity: the binary
calibration equations give the usual real values. This proves **Rich
Outcomes** and **Simple Expected Utility**, including all standing chart
conventions.

For the fixed randomized mixture, equality of its law with the mixture law
gives

$$v_{M_p(X,Z)}=p v_X+(1-p)v_Z.$$

Subtracting the corresponding expression with $Y$ and rescaling
$\varepsilon$ by $p>0$ proves the full **Mixture Independence** biconditional.

Write $S_X(s)=\Pr(X>s)$. The elementary clipped-tail identity gives

$$v_X(t)-v_Y(t)=\int_{-t}^{2t}(S_X(s)-S_Y(s))\,ds.\tag{2}$$

If $S_X\ge S_Y$ pointwise, this is nonnegative. If an inequality is strict
at a threshold, right continuity supplies an interval where the difference
is bounded below by a positive constant. All sufficiently large windows
contain that interval, giving a fixed strictly positive gap in (2). Thus
(1) preserves both weak and strict **Stochastic Dominance**. These
verifications establish the entire DTU package.

Two useful consequences of (1) will be used below. Adding a function tending
to zero to $v_X-v_Y$ does not change the comparison, by an
$\varepsilon/2$ argument. If $v_X-v_Y$ tends to a finite number $r$, the
comparison holds exactly when $r\ge0$; when the limit is zero both directions
hold. A limit of $+\infty$ or $-\infty$ yields the corresponding strict
comparison.

## Expectation, CDF area, and continuity

For integrable $X$, $q_t(X)\to X$ pointwise and $|q_t(X)|\le |X|$.
Dominated convergence gives $v_X(t)\to E[X]$. The preceding limit criterion
proves **Expected Utility**.

Clipping is 1-Lipschitz. Whenever $E|X-Y|<\infty$,

$$q_t(X)-q_t(Y)\longrightarrow X-Y,\qquad
|q_t(X)-q_t(Y)|\le |X-Y|.$$

Hence $v_X-v_Y\to E[X-Y]$, even when the individual expectations do not
exist. The limit criterion proves **Relative Expectation** for the variables'
actual coupling, without replacing that coupling by a more convenient one.

For **CDF-Area Extension**, put $d=S_X-S_Y$ and
$A_\pm=\int_{\mathbb R}d_\pm$. The nested windows $[-t,2t]$ exhaust
$\mathbb R$, so their positive and negative integrals tend monotonically to
$A_+$ and $A_-$. If at least one area is finite, (2) tends to their
well-defined difference in the extended reals. If both are finite and equal,
the limit is zero; if the positive area is larger, including the case of a
single positive infinity, the limit is positive; the reverse cases are
negative. Thus $X\succeq Y$ holds exactly when $A_+\ge A_-$ in every case
specified by the principle. Nothing here specifies the both-infinite pairs.

For **L¹ Continuity**, suppose $\delta_n=E|X_n-X|\to0$ and
$X_n\succeq Y$ for every $n$. The Lipschitz property gives

$$|v_{X_n}(t)-v_X(t)|\le\delta_n\quad\text{for every }t.$$

Fix $\varepsilon>0$, and choose $n$ with $\delta_n<\varepsilon/2$.
On a large set, $v_{X_n}-v_Y\ge-\varepsilon/2$, hence
$v_X-v_Y\ge-\varepsilon$. This is precisely (1) for $X\succeq Y$.
The proof verifies the topic's upper-section clause on the full domain,
including nonintegrable $X$ and $Y$.

## Shifts

For each fixed real $b$ and arbitrary $X$,

$$q_t(X+b)-q_t(X)\longrightarrow b,\qquad
|q_t(X+b)-q_t(X)|\le |b|.$$

Dominated convergence gives $v_{X+b}-v_X\to b$. Simultaneously shifting
$X,Y$ therefore changes their comparison function by a function tending to
zero. This proves **Shift Invariance**, in both directions.

For $0<p<1$, subtract the values of the two mixtures in **Transfer of a
Shift Across a Mixture**:

$$\begin{aligned}
&v_{M_p(X+b/p,Y)}-v_{M_p(X,Y+b/(1-p))}\\
&\qquad=p(v_{X+b/p}-v_X)
 -(1-p)(v_{Y+b/(1-p)}-v_Y)\longrightarrow b-b=0.
\end{aligned}$$

The mixtures are therefore indifferent. Neither shift conclusion has used
reflection symmetry or finite individual expectations.

## A symmetric Cauchy has positive value

Let $C_\sigma$ have the symmetric Cauchy density
$\sigma/[\pi(\sigma^2+x^2)]$, where $\sigma>0$. Such a variable is available
on the fixed atomless probability space. Direct integration over the window
and its two clipped tails gives

$$v_{C_\sigma}(t)=
\frac{\sigma}{2\pi}\log\frac{\sigma^2+4t^2}{\sigma^2+t^2}
+\frac{2t}{\pi}\arctan\frac{\sigma}{2t}
-\frac{t}{\pi}\arctan\frac{\sigma}{t}
\longrightarrow \frac{\sigma\log2}{\pi}.\tag{3}$$

Indeed the logarithmic term tends to $\sigma\log2/\pi$, while the last
two terms each tend in magnitude to $\sigma/\pi$ and cancel. Put
$k=\log2/\pi>0$. Equation (3) yields $C_1\sim k\succ0$.

This one comparison proves three failures:

- **Symmetric Gambles Are Neutral** fails: $C_1$ and $-C_1$ have the same
  law but $C_1\not\sim0$.
- **Reflection Anti-Invariance** fails: $C_1\succeq0$, whereas
  $0\not\succeq-C_1$. Its special case $a=1,b=0$ also directly refutes
  **Negative Affine Anti-Invariance**.
- **Folded Expectation** fails: both $C_1$ and zero have identically zero
  combined symmetric tail difference, so that principle would require
  them to be indifferent.

For **Uniqueness of Negative Self-Similarity**, take
$p=1/2$, $a=2$, $b=0$, and $Z=0$. The variables $-2C_1$ and $C_2$ have
the same law. By (3) and mixture linearity,

$$v_{M_{1/2}(-2C_1,0)}\longrightarrow\tfrac12(2k)=k,
\qquad C_1\sim M_{1/2}(-2C_1,0).$$

Zero also satisfies $0\sim M_{1/2}(-2\cdot0,0)$. The two fixed values
are distinct because $C_1\succ0$. This refutes precisely the recorded
uniqueness principle.

## Alternating St Petersburg is zero

Let $A$ take $(-2)^n$ with probability $2^{-n}$, $n\ge1$. Group consecutive
odd and even indices. Each pair has a negative outcome $-a$ of probability
$2r$ and positive outcome $2a$ of probability $r$, where $a,r>0$.
For every $t>0$,

$$q_t(-a)=-\min(a,t),\qquad q_t(2a)=2\min(a,t),$$

so the pair contributes exactly zero. Clipping makes the expectation
absolutely integrable, which licenses grouping the countably many pairs.
Thus $v_A(t)=0$ for every $t$, and $A\sim0$. In particular
**Alternating St Petersburg = −1/2** fails.

## Scope of the verification

This model establishes, among other separations, that DTU together with
CDF-Area Extension, Relative Expectation, $L^{1}$ Continuity, and both shift
principles still does not force symmetric neutrality or reflection. No
scale or sum-invariance verdict has been inferred from this construction.
The map can derive further failures from its separately proved
incompatibility records.

`checks/asymmetric_continuous_ultrafilter.py` checks the paired-atom
cancellations with exact rational arithmetic, finite-law clipped-tail and
mixture identities, the Lipschitz bound, and the explicit Cauchy limits.
Those checks are sanity checks of concrete calculations; the universal
properties and ultrafilter comparisons are proved analytically above.

## Failure of Comonotonic Sum Invariance

**Addition: Claude (Fable 5.1), 23 September 2026.** A property of the
recorded model; not a claim of the source papers.

Realize a standard Cauchy variable as $C=Q_C(U)=\tan(\pi(U-\tfrac12))$ and
put $X=0$, $Y=C-\ln(2)/\pi$, $Z=C_+=\max(C,0)$; all are nondecreasing in
$U$, so both pairs $(X,Z)$, $(Y,Z)$ are comonotonic. By the Cauchy
calculation above, $\mathbb E[q_t(C)]\to\ln(2)/\pi$, and
$q_t(C-v)-q_t(C)\to-v$ boundedly, so $\mathbb E[q_t(Y)]\to0$ and $X\sim Y$.

**Doubling-defect identity.** For any nonnegative random variable $V$ and
any $F>0$,

$$2\,\mathbb E[\min(V,F)]-\mathbb E[\min(2V,F)]
 =2\int_{F/2}^{F}P(V>x)\,dx,$$

since $\mathbb E[\min(V,F)]=\int_0^F P(V>x)\,dx$ and
$\mathbb E[\min(2V,F)]=2\int_0^{F/2}P(V>x)\,dx$. For $V=C_+=\max(C,0)$ with
$C$ standard Cauchy the right-hand side is
$\frac2\pi\int_{F/2}^{F}\arctan(1/x)\,dx$, which is positive for every $F$
and increases to $\frac{2\ln2}{\pi}$ as $F\to\infty$.

Write $m(F)=\mathbb E[\min(C_+,F)]$ and $C_-=\min(C,0)$. Then
$X+Z=C_+$ and $Y+Z=2C_++C_--\ln(2)/\pi$, and with the window $[-t,2t]$,

$$\mathbb E[q_t(C_+)]=m(2t),\qquad
\mathbb E[q_t(2C_++C_-)]=2m(t)-m(t)=m(t),\qquad
\mathbb E[q_t(C)]=m(2t)-m(t).$$

Hence, using the bounded shift once more,

$$v_{X+Z}(t)-v_{Y+Z}(t)=m(2t)-m(t)+\frac{\ln2}{\pi}+o(1)
 =2\bigl(m(2t)-m(t)\bigr)+o(1)\longrightarrow\frac{2\ln2}{\pi}.$$

With $\varepsilon=(\ln2)/\pi$ the set $\{t:v_{Y+Z}(t)\ge v_{X+Z}(t)-\varepsilon\}$
is bounded, so $X+Z\succ Y+Z$ although $X\sim Y$: Comonotonic Sum Invariance
fails, while both shift principles hold. `checks/comonotonic_witnesses.py`
verifies the closed forms, the neutral constant and the limit.

## Integer-ratio self-similarity

**Addition: Claude (Fable 5.1), 24 September 2026.** The uniqueness witness
above has ratio $a=2$, so the model also fails Uniqueness of Negative
Self-Similarity (integer ratios), the restriction of the principle to integer
ratios.


## A fixed shuffle copula

**Added 2 October 2026.** The AI-generated report communicated by **Branden
Fitelson**, *Unbounded Utility: Five Top-Ranked Open Conjectures Resolved*
(30 September 2026), §4(b), supplies a new property of this construction.
Its producers are identified as Claude agents, with model versions unspecified.
GPT-6 (Codex) expanded and informally checked the argument.

The [fixed shuffle-copula proof](calibrated-geometric-continuous-ultrafilter.html#shared-clipping-and-shuffle-copula-proof)
applies to this model's cutoffs and tolerance-based ultrafilter comparison.
It proves **Existential Copula Sum Invariance** using one copula for all
triples, including atomic marginals. This does not change the model's
existing failure of Comonotonic Sum Invariance. The original construction
and earlier results retain their original attribution. The expanded model
has no Lean verification; its earlier record was marked stated.
